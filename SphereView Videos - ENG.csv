ENG,English,FAM,FAM-CAT-1,https://youtu.be/Mnne3_AoPcs,,,,"SECTION INTRODUCTION
So we're going to divide this in several sections. The first one, we're going to look at 10 passages that talk about God in this sphere of family. Family is foundational to society, marriage was established by God in Genesis 2 before the fall; this was when everything was good. It's his design for extending his blessings to the nations of the earth.",,,,,,
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-01,https://youtu.be/gJ6D09PS_50,,,,"Number 1: God is like a Good Father.
We take this from 1 John 3:1-2. It says, see what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it does not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God. And what we will be has not yet been made known, but we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him for, we shall see him as he is.
You know that the Original Testament refers to God as father only 19 times. That might be surprising to you. This was not the common way that the Jewish people spoke of God. It was much too intimate. But when Jesus came on the scene, he addresses God as father 190 times: ten times more than all the Old Testament. And this is was highly unusual.
It was not mindless repetition of cultural verbiage that he was just saying. Jesus was trying to communicate to his audience, that God wants to have an intimate familial relationship with them. Among the Jewish people, they spoke of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the fathers. He was their God. And Jesus wanted to make know that God is our God, like your father. The one who first saw you upon birth and who occasioned conception. He is that close to you. So relational intimacy is supposed to be present reality. He taught us to pray our Father. Our Father. Not just Jesus', but our father because of what Jesus has done.",How could seeing God as your loving Father transform your life?,"How can seeing God as a good Father transform families?

",,,What step will you take today based on your new insights?,
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-02,https://youtu.be/xOd9g19Usqo,,,,"Number 2: God is Like a Good Mother.
Isaiah 49:15 says, …Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? But even if that were possible, I would not forget you.
See, family is to be the place of ever present, constant caring and love. It's attentive love. I can't imagine my mom ever having forgotten me. She was always thinking about me and my brothers and sisters. But even if she had, God does not. As you know these terms, God is our father and God is mother: These are not gender defining terms. God is above gender; Father and mother are metaphors. They're the life givers. They're the life protectors. They're the life enhancers. And those are the things that we're supposed to experience in family, when we do it, according to Biblical patterns.",Why does Isaiah 49:15 compare God to a mother and how does this affect your view of God?,"If people experienced God's constant, attentive love what are some ways society could be transformed? ",,,How will you apply today's knowledge in your life?,Reflect on a time God comforted you tenderly like a mother.
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-03,https://youtu.be/Rps8Y9QaGt0,,,,"Number 3: God is a Father to the Fatherless
Our third passage is this. God is a Father to the Fatherless. This comes from Psalm 68:5-6. He said that he is a Father to the fatherless, defender of widows — this is God, whose dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families…
You know, when we talk about this subject, not everyone lives in an ideal family. Some of you have a lot of pain from your family background. Your family may have been broken, dysfunctional, or just non-existent. Whatever your situation, God is there for you. If you are fatherless, he's there for you. If you're a widow, he's there for you. If you're lonely, he's there for you. God wants to come to re-parent us, to re-family us, to restore us, to take that which was not as it should have been and create what it ought to have been. That's what coming into the family of God is all about. He fills the void and he makes up for life's brokenness. This is what family is supposed to be like. None of us have a perfect family, but all of us have a perfect God who wants to restore the idea of family and our experience through the way he deals with us.",How have you experienced God's fatherly care in your own life?,How God can re-parent and re-family those from broken backgrounds?,,,What change are you motivated to make after today's discoveries?,How could mentors provide family stability to the vulnerable?
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-04,https://youtu.be/6mvjpD6b970,,,,"Number 4: God is a Faithful Husband to an Unfaithful People.
This concept comes from Hosea 3:1. Then the Lord said to me (this is Hosea the prophet talking) go and love your wife again. Even though she commits adultery with another lover. This will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them.
Hosea had a very painful life. He was a man of God, he loved God and he loved his wife, but his wife was unfaithful to him. And he thought, what should I do? Should I divorce her? Or should I leave her? And God said keep loving her, because all my people are unfaithful and I keep loving them. Faithful loyalty and unconditional commitment are hallmarks of God's relationship with us. And they should be the things that characterize the relationship between a husband and wife. It models what family is supposed to be like. God loves us relentlessly. Even when we don't reciprocate. Even when we don't respond in kind, he keeps on loving us. This is remarkable. And this is what family love is supposed to look like. Does it look like that in your family? How can we change it? How can we love more? How we can be imitators of God in our family. This is what we're trying to learn how to do. As we look at this very foundational sphere in our society.",Reflect on how God has shown you unconditional love.,"Are there aspects of your culture that undermine loyalty and commitment in relationships and how can you pray for change?

ENG,English,FAM,FAM-05,https://youtu.be/pnjUWbs_JYQ,,,,"Number 5: God Desires to Bless All Families.
This is amazing. We find this in Genesis 12:1- 3. This is God's very first statement to Abraham. It says this, the Lord said to Abram, leave your native country, your relatives and your father's family, and go to the land that I will show you. I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous. And you will be a blessing to others. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt. All the families on earth will be blessed through you. 
You know, Abraham is considered the father of faith. He's the one who's the head of the story for Christians and Jews and Muslims alike. And he is a heroic man who knew God. His story starts off sounding like God's anti-family. Leave your father, leave your relatives, then we head out to something new. But that sacrifice, his family sacrifice, was intended to bring great blessing to all families.
Right from the very beginning, in this first statement we see that God's focus is on family. And his purpose is to see families blessed.
It’s interesting. In this passage having blessed families is the foundation for becoming a great nation. By focusing on families as God has, we can see the strategic place for this institution in our societies and our cultures. Are we giving it enough importance? Are we really valuing families? If we don’t emphasize this sufficiently, we will suffer cultural harm. Our societies will crumble. We'll not be the blessed people God wants us to be. This is not true for just one culture. It's true for every family on earth, throughout the globe. This is God's purpose. Whatever your culture, whatever your nation, whatever your language, family is to be the foundation for blessing.",How has your family experienced God's blessing?,Why does God want every family blessed?,,,How has today's information inspired you to act?,What can you do to be a blessing to families in your community?
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-06,https://youtu.be/YnRpv9yy0xc,,,,"Number 6: God Chooses Abraham to Train His Children.
We read this in Genesis 18:18-19. For Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation. And all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him. I've singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just. Then I will do for Abraham all that I have promised.
Have you ever wondered why did God choose Abraham of all people? Why him? I mean, he was from a pagan culture, living in a pagan land. Around him was idolatry. Why was Abraham selected? The key is found in this phrase here. He says, I have singled him out ""so that"". Other translations say, ""because""; so whether it's ""so that"" or ""because"" we get something really key. Its either the reason he's selected him because he's going to train his children or, or the purpose, because he could see that he was going to train his children. So whether it's the reason or the purpose of God's selection, the heart of God's eyes on Abraham was he knew that he was going to live for the next generation. Living for the wellbeing of your children and the next generation, investing in them, pouring yourself into them, equipping them for life. This is what pleases God, this is what draws his attention. So that's someone I want to have. That's what I can choose. I can select. I can use. Let's make the next generation our focus and investment.",What are practical ways you can take to train and equip the next generation?,Why is multi-generational investment so pleasing to God?,,,"In light of today's lessons, what will you do differently?",What could improve if education was more parent-driven?

I loveNumber seven: Psalm 90:1 says, God is Our Home. Let me read that passage: Lord, through all the generations you have been our home.
What an amazing statement. Home is the place of security, of identity, of belonging; a destiny-shaping place characterized by acceptance. A place where we're surrounded by a supportive and loving environment. This is what God is to us. We've been drawn into the Trinitarian family, into the Godhead -- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They've included us in their circle of love, an unbroken, indescribable love, and they've made us family. His family. Adopting us into that intimacy of relationship. When we walk with the Father, with the Son and with the Spirit, we are home.",Reflect on how God has been a secure home for you.,"

ENG,English,FAM,FAM-08,https://youtu.be/tfyNifvFd7k,,,,"Number 8: God First. All Else Second. 
This comes from Genesis 22:1-18. I'm going to read just a few selections from this passage. But this is the story of when God asked Abraham to take his son, Isaac who's 12 years old, and offer him up as a sacrifice. And at the last moment, God stops his hand and Isaac is saved and a ram is sacrificed in his place. The place where this happened was Mount Moriah, a place which would later be where the temple was built. And later, near where Jesus died.
""Don't lay a hand on the boy,"" the angel said, ""do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God, you have not withheld from Me even your son, your only son. 
(And that phrase, I just had to interrupt the reading to say, it certainly sounds like God's son. God's only son who actually went through and gave his life for us in the very near proximity to this place.)
The angel went on to say, …because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear, by my own name that I will certainly bless you. I will multiply your descendants beyondNumber like the stars of the sky, the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies. And through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed — all because you have obeyed me.
You know, sometimes you hear people say with good intention: God first, family second, and ministry, or work or professional vocation that comes third. Though it is well intentioned, this is not biblical. The biblical story is simply this: God first. Period. Everything else, you simply have to listen to God. You have to hear and obey. And at times you, you make sacrifices. You relinquish a promotion in your workplace because your family needs you more at home at that time. And other times, as a family, you choose to make a sacrifice to accomplish some task that is needful, but you don't make an idol of either family or ministry/work/vocation.
Both were given by God, to Adam, in Genesis 2. God gave Adam a job He actually gave him two jobs. One to tend to the garden, that’s a production job, an agricultural gardening job. He also gave him a scientific research job to name the animals, to classify them and give them the appropriate nomenclature. So, he was actually given two jobs. And then in the process of doing that, it became apparent that he needed help. And so, God also gave him a wife.
All of this is before the Fall and all needed to be yielded to God. God is the giver of the vocation. God is the giver of the spouse and everything we do is yielded in obedience to him.  When we've set our hearts to hear and obey God, we know when to focus on family and when to prioritize ministry.

Joshua 24:15. At the end of Joshua's remarkable long life he looks back on all the years that he walked with Moses, and the 40 years after that, and he challenged the people about their loyalty. Will they serve God or will they serve idols? And he goes through a long discourse. His concluding speech ends up with his famous statement: Whatever you decide… this is my choice. … as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.
Serving God should not only be an individual activity. It should be a family activity. We do this corporately. We do this together and we can't make choices for one another, but we can choose together as a family to serve and follow and honor God.",How could you lead your family to serve God together more?,What would change in society if serving God was done as a family? ,,,What commitment will you make after today's learning?,"

ENG,English,FAM,FAM-10,https://youtu.be/KAv0BLSp_3k,,,,"Number 10: Fight For Your Family.
This comes from Nehemiah 4:13-14. So I placed armed guards behind the lowest parts of the wall and exposed areas. I stationed the people to stand guard by families armed with sword, spears, and bows. And as I looked over the situation I called together the nobles and the rest of the people and said to them, don't be afraid of the enemy. Remember the Lord who was great and glorious and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes. 
This is a story about them rebuilding the wall around Jerusalem after returning from exile. It was a precarious situation.

This next section we're going to look at is about biblical principles for husbands and wives. It involves 12 different passages. And this really is the heart of family. It is the volitional part. You can't choose your parents, but you do choose your spouse. And, so when you do, that choice is a choice to love, a choice to give yourself in service and caring for someone else. And that choice to love is the foundation for family. It's the beginning of family. It really is the heart of family. So let's look at this.",,,,,,
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-11,https://youtu.be/Yeh314vVsq0,,,,"Number 11: God Creates Eve and Institutes Marriage.
We read this in Genesis 2:18,21-25. Here are a few selections. Then the Lord God said, ""It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.""... Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib, and he brought her to the man. ""At last!"" the man exclaimed. ""This one is bone from my bone and flesh from my flesh! She will be called 'woman' because she was taken from 'man.'"" This explains why a man leaves his father and mother, and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one...
There are several things here that need to be said because we, in many of our cultures, we have distorted views on gender and the roles between men and women. Some have said, well, the Bible teaches that man, Adam was created first and then woman. So man is definitely superior, should always be in first place. They missed the point. Before Adam was created, donkeys and frogs were. So if first means more valuable, then frogs make the top of the list. Seemed like God was always going from good to better to best. In fact, the only time in the whole creation story of chapters one and two that God says something was not good is after he made Adam and before he had made Eve. And when they were both together, he said it was very good. Go figure. Okay.
The other thing that is often misunderstood, he says, I will make a helper. Like when we think helper, we kind of think of like maybe an office assistant someone who is not as important as the boss. But that's not what the Bible is talking about.
Think about it this way. When you were having struggles with math in school and you were coming up to a big test and you needed someone to help you, who did you look for among your classmates? The smartest person or the dumbest person to help you? The smartest, right? You wanted good help, not lousy help.
Or perhaps you are very scrawny and weak and bully of the school would beat you up on the way home from school every day. And you needed some help. Who do you find? Someone as scrawny and weak as you or someone big and strong? Of course, you look for the smart one and you look for the strong one. That's the kind of help we look for.
This Hebrew word for helper is 'ezer. It's found 21 times in the Old Testament. A couple of times is used for an ally, like a military army. Like Israel went down to Egypt and formed an alliance, so they would help them against an invading force. And they did that because they saw they had capacity that they didn't have. But that's just a few times. And except for this one instance, that's the only time it's just one individual. Every other time it is used to talk about God. Where does my help come from? Where does my 'ezer come from? My help, my 'ezer comes from the Lord. And he is our Ebenezer, the one who's helped us up to this point. So this is a very strong word. It literally means a strong savior.
So woman is to be highly valued, highly regarded. And when Adam sees her for the first time he breaks into poetry. It is the first poetic literature in the Bible. Bone from my bone and flesh from my flesh. She is to be a full companion that that comes from his side, not from the bones from his feet so he can step on her or from her brain so she can dominate over him. They'll be side by side together in life. And God institutes marriage as it’s supposed to be: always together for all time.",Reflect on ways your view of marriage should align more closely with God's pattern.,How does your community benefit from guarding and strengthening marriage relationships?,,,How will you transform today's knowledge into action?,
ENG,English,FAM,FAM-12,https://youtu.be/p4AEBlqOlE0,,,,"Number 12: Ideal Marriage Pattern is Given to Priests.
We read about this in Leviticus 21:7, 13-15. Here's some selections. Priests may not marry a woman defiled by prostitution, and they may not marry a woman who's divorced from her husband, for the priests are set apart as holy to their God… The high priest may marry only a virgin. He may not marry a widow, a woman who's divorced, or a woman who defiles herself by prostitution. She must be a virgin from her, his own clan so that he will not dishonor his descendants among his clan for, I am the Lord who makes him holy.
Now this is an interesting passage because we don't find any place in the Bible where it says to all people, you can only marry a virgin. So people said, well, see, premarital sex is okay. That's not the case. This is given to the priest and the high priest as who those are to model the ideal within the culture of how you should live. They are called to live the most righteously, the most holy way. That's the word that this finishes off. The ideal is stated in hopes that as people aspire toward it that it becomes normative. It is the best, what people aspire to. This is the ultimate, the most desirable form of marriage. It's not imposed on all, but given as a dream to inspire all, to shoot high, to shoot for this standard so that we would all walk with great integrity in our marriage and our live up to our marriage.
Now at the same time, God knows there's a lot of brokenness in the world. So there are lots of stories of redemption in the Bible. When we didn't live up to the dream, when we’ve failed, when we did things that we ought not to have done, and our dreams have been broken: we have the story of a God who comes to rewrite our story because he's a Redeemer.",Why is it important to value puriy and faithfulness?,How can married couples mentor youth in goldy relationships?,,,"In response to today's learning, what changes will you implement?",

This comes from Song of Solomon 5:1. I have entered my garden, my treasure, my bride! I gather myrrh with my spices and eat honeycomb with my honey. I drink wine with my milk.
Sex in the Bible. Yes, for some it's surprising to find a poem of love and sexual intimacy included in the Bible. What should we make of it? Some suggest that we should read it only symbolically as a picture of God's unconditional love for his people. Others suggest that it is best understood as a marriage handbook and find the treasure of marital delights in it.
Perhaps there's value in both approaches. At any rate. Song of Songs is a beautiful picture of the physical side of love and its appropriate expression within the bonds of marriage, as part of God's wonderful creation.
You know, this book is a literary drama, not to be acted out, but orally recited, to speak to the hearers of the virtue, wonder and beauty of marriage. But it warns, it advises those who are listening to this dramatic presentation of how special the singular love of one man with one woman is.
Sometimes the translations say that this song was written by Solomon, but actually that should that it was written for Solomon. Because it talked about Solomon's wedding with 60 in chapter 3, with 60 queens. Maybe this was a court jester who wrote this. Who, seeing the trend that was going on in Solomon's life, and what about the one special one, And all the queens are saying it's better to have just one than many of us. Maybe it was his way to exhort Solomon to stop his reckless addition of more and more wives to his harem. And to emphasize the beauty of God's original design of one man, one woman. Unfortunately, if that was the case, we can only speculate. But Solomon did not heed and went on to have 300 wives and 700 concubines, not an example for marriage.
This drama takes us to the longing of the lovers in courtship of chapter 1- 3:5; and then to a wedding scene in chapter 3:6-11. Finally the honeymoon, chapter four, all the way through 5:2 and including this passage that we just read; followed by married life from 5:3-8:7.

Hebrews 13:4. Marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
Honored means valued. It's what is desired. Many of our cultures celebrate premarital and extramarital sex. That's what the movies and novels are made about. And they make crude jokes about the poor guy who gets married. It portrays life with your wife or your husband as miserable. This perspective needs to be changed in our cultures.

This is Ephesians 5:21- 6:9. Going to read just a few selections at the very end of this part. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives and husbands. Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself. And the wife must respect her husband. Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. Fathers do not exasperate your children instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ and masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Since you know that he was both their master, is in heaven. And there was no favoritism with him.
You know if you treat your slave in the same way that you expect the slave to treat you, he's no longer a slave and you're no longer a master. You're equals. You're brothers. And this is the point. In Ephesians, Paul writes — sit, walk, stand is an easy way to think of it. The first three chapters how we're seated in heavenly places. And chapter 4-6:9 is how we walk out our Christian life. And then 6:10 to the end is about how we stand and the spiritual warfare against the enemy.
And this middle part, this walk, the Greek word is peripateo, and it can mean walk or live. It's used five times. In 4:1 is walk worthy of the calling or live worthy of the calling. And 4:17 is walk not as Gentiles; 5:1 is walk in love; and 5:8 is walk in the light; and 5:15 is walk carefully or walk with wisdom. Be careful how you walk, be careful how you live. It goes on and says, the way we do this is not by being filled with wine, but being filled with the Spirit.
And then it tells you various ways of how to be filled with the Spirit, like singing and making music and praising God. And then, surprisingly - this was a very long sentence in Greek - he goes on —the final way of how you know that you've been filled with the Spirit is that you're submitting to one another.
This mutuality is the foundation that then spills over into the three pairs: husband -wife, parent-child, and master-slave. And this is revolutionary because in that culture, those weren't mutual relationships, they were hierarchical relationships, and Paul is changing that so that we care for each other. And we recognize the value of each individual. And we break down the dividing walls. Paul uses languages for his culture. Greek and Roman law, even Jewish laws, extra biblical laws, rabbinic laws had requirements for the husband, father, master and others for the wife, the children and the slave.

1Corinthians 7:2-34. Here's some selections. This builds on the same idea that Paul had, of how we come together as equals in the marriage relationship. He says this, the husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife. And likewise, the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but yields to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but yields it to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband and a husband must not divorce his wife. A married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife. A married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please, her husband.
I've just read four of ten different parallel statements that are found in this chapter, linking husbands and wives. Paul presents a picture of marriage that is extraordinarily startling in its simplicity and its unrelenting equity. In this picture, he portrays a radical reciprocity going back and forth of rights and responsibilities that totally dismantles any cultural double standard.
When we're talking about discipling nations, double standards destroy people. It creates injustice and brokenness and pain. No longer is gender the great divide. Paul levels the playing field, applying the truth of the cross to the gender issue, finding common ground. He does this by speaking to both men and women in equal terms, sometimes addressing the men first. Sometimes the women. Sometimes both together. What is spoken to one partner is similarly and consistently addressed to the other, creating a seamless symmetry of obligations and expectations.",Reflect on the radical mutuality presented in 1 Corinthians 7.,What are some ways mutuality in marraige could transform society?,,,"After today's insights, what is your action plan?",

Deuteronomy 5:18 from the 10 commandments. You can also find this in Exodus 20. This is commandmentNumber seven. You shall not commit adultery.
You know, adultery is really a matter of the heart. In the Torah, the 10 commandments in both of the Exodus and Deuteronomy versions, is more about a classroom than it is about a courtroom. The word ""torah"", which is often translated ""law"" has is more to do with the idea of teaching. I want to understand what's right. We should value what is right, so we make it into law and we should do what is right. We should live holy lives.
Teaching. In the process of teaching you are always moving from external to internal, from concrete to abstract. As we grow, as we mature, we understand not just the rules, but the why behind the rules. And Jesus understands this and he takes this as necessary conclusion. Jesus follows the implication implicit in the command here in Deuteronomy 5.
And in the Sermon on the Mount, He says this, ""You've heard the commandment that says you must not commit adultery. But I say anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.""
Now, you might sit there and say, well, I've never had sex with another man's wife. That's notable. But, probably no one who's an adult can say, I've never had a lustful thought. We all are in need of a change at a heart level. We're not talking here (when we're talking about transformation in society) about changing the externals without changing the internal. And we can't do that by ourselves. That's why Jesus comes. He comes to transform us inside out so that the thoughts of our minds and the motivations of our hearts are changed.

follows up on this. David Repents of Adultery. Psalm 51. All the whole psalm is about this; here are a few selections. Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins… Purify me from my sins, and I will be clean. Wash me and I will be whiter than snow… Don't keep looking at my sins. Remove the stain of my guilt. Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a loyal spirit within me… Restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you… You do not desire a sacrifice or I would offer one. You do not want a burnt offering. The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit. You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God…
David wrote this psalm after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba and to cover that one sin, he committed another sin. He arranged for her husband to be killed on the battlefield. This husband had been a loyal friend and supporter, one of David's Mighty Men from the very beginning of his journey, even before he was king. This was such a grievous act of disloyalty, disloyalty to God, to friend, to the way things should be done. And, he didn't recognize it as such until Nathan the prophet came and told the story of a man who had many sheep and a neighbor had only one sheep. And he had guests that came in and, he didn't want to kill one of his sheep. So he grabbed his neighbor's one sheep killed that sheep to offer a meal to the guests in hospitality.
David got angry when he heard this. How could this be? And Nathan said, ""You're the man!"" And David quickly repented. He understood what was being said. He realized he had done a grave wrong. And this gives us all hope. We don't live flawless lives. If we learn to be like David and be quick to repent, quick to turn, there is hope of redemption.
Acts 13:22 quotes 1 Samuel 13. And still considering that David was a man after God's own heart. He had fallen in some very bad sins. This was not praiseworthy at all. But the quickness to repent, the fact that he did not cover up, that he came out and was straightforward, and he says ""Create in me a clean heart. Renew a loyal spirit within me"", allowed God to forgive him. So we have to come to God if we have failed in these areas. If we failed in loyalty to family members, we have to seek God with a broken and repentant heart like David did. Broken means that you really embrace the sorrow, the grief of what you've done and repentant means that you've made the determination with God's help to change. You want to live a different life.

This comes from Mark 12:18-27. Here's some selections. Jesus was approached by some Sadducees — religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on his brother's name. Well suppose there were seven brothers...
And they spin this yarn out. His brother marries a woman. He dies, and so the next brother marries her and he dies, and successively, until all seven have had the same woman. Now this is laughable in their culture because it was allowable for man to have multiple wives, but not for a woman to have multiple husbands. But the question was, and I continue with the passage , ""whose wife will she be in the resurrection?""
This seems so ludicrous. It was like, they're saying, obviously God would not allow that to happen. So there can't be any resurrection. ""Well, all seven of our marriage to her."" Jesus replied, ""Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures and you don't know the power of God. For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage… But now, as to whether the dead will be raised haven't you read …He’s the God of the living, not of the dead.""
Look how Jesus does this. He talks about God. God is the God of Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob. And the scriptures say that after Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are dead. And because it says ""he is"" in present tense, he says, he's not the God of the dead, but of the living. So that means Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive.
So he exposed their double standard on marriage and exposed their ignorance of God and the Scriptures and His ways. It's important to understand though, that it says that neither marry, they won't be married or being given in marriage in heaven, doesn't mean that there's not family. There're no new marriages. The only wedding ceremony there in heaven is the marriage feast of the lamb. The family will still be recognized in heaven.

So we'll begin with our 23rd key passage. Children Are a Gift from God, Psalm 127:3-5. Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warrior's hands. How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.
This is really important passage for many in our world today, because many see children as a burden, as a risk, as something that keeps you from doing what you really want to do, your profession, your vocation, they're costly- too much money, and they limit your freedom. These thoughts are a result of a humanistic worldview, which sees virtue as me experiencing maximum personal individual fulfillment.
We're called to invest the lives of others. And there's nothing greater, no greater joy, no greater destiny, no greater legacy, than investing in the life of the next generation of children. Children should not be seen as a pain or problem. The world is designed for many people, billions more than currently are alive to be sustainable. There's not a population problem. There's a love problem. We don't love enough. We don't care enough. They're not a burden. They're a blessing.
It's interesting that this passage uses the language of arrows. An arrow is shaped as you know: the arrowhead, the shaft and it has to just be straight and the feathers at the end, which helped guide it in balance and flight. The arrow was designed that you keep it in your quiver for some time. Its purpose is to not for it to stay in the quiver, but to be fitted to a bow and launched to a great distance and to accomplish something that will benefit and protect the family. And that is an important thought. Parents are to be shapers of the children as someone who manufactures an arrow. So they will fly straight. They will fly true.

Psalm 139:13-16. You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvelous —how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion. As I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born…
Friends, we know that you and I came to life because at one point, your father and mother, as was in the case, my father and mother were joined sexually. And the two cells came together and conception happened. But who you are, who I am, who each one of us is, is so much more than the biology and the DNA of those two cells. You have a unique fingerprints and mother nature doesn’t do that. The Creator God, the Father of the universe, is the one who does that.
Nature just takes existing DNA and blends it. It doesn't do something new or innovative. If you cross a red rose with a yellow rose, you're going to have a red rose with the yellow edge around it. It was going to be a yellow rose with red flecks on it, or maybe orange-ish, but you're never going to have a purple rose. It can't do something unique. It just takes and re-blends, repackages what is. But you are unique. Your fingerprints are unique. Your retina prints are unique. Your voice prints are unique. Your walk is unique. Your face is unique. Everything about you is unique. There's not another copy like you. And beyond those physical elements, the talents, the gifts (who you are) that's unique.
And that's because you're a combination, both of your parents physical union, and God's spiritual intervention. Just like when he made Adam from dirt, he breathed on him. In the dirt was all the chemical stuff, all the DNA, all the prime material, all the raw material, everything that was needed, but he wasn't a living soul until God breathed on him. When those two cells come together God breathes on you and makes you, you. You're handmade by God. And that is good news.
Maybe you weren't especially loved as a child. Maybe you're a girl and your father wanted a boy, or maybe it was just the opposite. You're a boy and your mom wanted a girl.

Genesis 15:1-6. …Abraham replied, ""O Sovereign Lord what good all your blessings when I don't even have a son? Since you've given me no children, Eliezer of Damascus, a servant in my household will inherit all my wealth. You've given me no descendants of my own, so one of my servants will be my heir.""
Then the Lord said to him, ""No, your servant will not be your heir, for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir."" Then the Lord took Abram outside and said to him, ""Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you will have!""
This is a remarkable story. And it portrays God's relationship with Abraham in a very intimate way. They're having this conversation like you would chat with your friend. It's not like a vision or a thought pattern. There, this is some kind of encounter with the living God. It's very tangible. Right in the middle of the story when they're talking about this, it says the Lord took Abraham outside. What was that like? Outside? Well it means that they were inside. Where? Probably the tent. He was a nomad, he cared for sheep. Abraham, it was his tent. He would have been the host. Also, if they're talking inside the tent.  God said, ""Let's go outside,"" and he probably would have opened the flap and they would duck their heads together. Did God hold him by the shoulder, put his arm around him, take it by the hand? How did God take him outside?
This is, you have got to put yourself in scene. God's really involved. He really cares. He is there. And He says, ""look up to the sky"". Abram wanted one son. He wanted a nine month miracle. God spoke of many, many descendants, not just one generation, but many generations afterwards that would be more than the stars of the sky. Millions upon millions upon millions.

If I had eaten the people's sin offering on such a tragic day as this, would the Lord have been pleased? And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
Now what is going on? What is the story about? In Leviticus, God is setting the rules of how to do religion. What kind of sacrifices and offerings to make and the role of the priests. And there are requirements on the priestly family that are not on the general population. And one of the things is that, they are supposed to treat the offerings with great respect. People bring the offerings at great sacrifice and they're not to use it for any personal way. And on this particular day, his two eldest sons, did not follow the instructions and fire fell and consumed them both. And he had to carry on and keep doing his work as a priest, even though there was great family pain.
Now this is the heart of the Levitical account of God's concern with justice and holiness. And there is a really important discovery to be made. If you read the book of Leviticus in the SourceView format you'll find the SphereView text in this book is almost all red, God's words with some few black passages of the narrator and every now and then a couple green words from Moses. The only blue text, the only time someone other than Moses or God speaks in this book is this little phrase right here, where Aaron, he keeps performing his service, but he can't bring himself to eat the sacrifice that he's supposed to eat because he's mourning the loss of his son. And so Moses said, ""Why aren't you following the rules? You know, you're supposed to do this."" And Aaron says, ""You know, please Moses, my brother, you know, just show mercy to me. My sons they are grieving because of the death of their brothers.""
God who so carefully had laid out the rules for the priesthood, readily understands and extends family compassion to him.

Deuteronomy 5:16. This is the fifth commandment. And it says this: Honor your father and mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land The Lord your God is giving you.
Why should we honor father and mother? Really why? Maybe you've got great parents. Maybe you have bad parents. Maybe your father abused you. Maybe your mother abandoned you. Maybe they're idolaters or worshipers of false gods. Are you supposed to honor them? There's no qualification on this passage. It doesn't say honor your father and mother if they're nice people. It says, full-stop. Why? Why? No matter what they did in their life after they gave birth to you, they gave you the greatest gift that you have. They gave you life. Because they are life-givers, like God is a life-giver, you are to honor them. It doesn't mean that you always obey them, but you have a great respect and gratitude and appreciation for them. Even though they may have done many wrong things after that time, you may need to be forgiving them and doing other things, but God honors life-givers. And so should we.
And when we realize that life is the greatest gift, everything follows. Once you honor your father and mother, you can't kill somebody else. If you honor life-giver, you can't be a life-taker. And that's commandmentNumber six.
And if you honor your father and mother, you really aren't going to be inclined to commit adultery. Because even though that's not taking someone's life, physically it’s taking the most special thing in someone's life relationally, emotionally.
And if you're honoring your father and mother, you seek  not only to protect other people's lives and to be true to your marital vows, but you're also not going to be a thief. Well, why not be a thief? Those inanimate things that have nothing to do with life. Well, if I buy a television, I have to work so many hours at so many dollars an hour to be able save up enough money to buy that television. So that television isn't all of my life.

I know that if you are like me, there are times growing up when your dad was talking to you and you just tuned out, right? You on the outside, you were nodding your head looking obedient, but inside you're thinking, I am gonna do whatever I want to do. Not a desirable thing to do.

Proverbs 3:11-12. My child, don't reject the Lord's discipline and don't be upset when he corrects you. For the Lord corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.
So when we correct as parents, we should do it in love, not in anger. And you need to do that very consistently. There's a process of that. We learned as young parents in our own family, that there's several steps in your disciplining of a child. Remember, you're not just taking out your emotions. No, that's not helpful. You're discipling them in the way they should go. So when, when there has been disobedience, when they have done something dangerous or wrong, something unkind, you get, you first get control of your own emotions and you sit with them and you help talk through and help them understand what was wrong. Make it clear you did this, you described the action and then help them define the motive behind that. I hit my sister and that was not kind. So, lack of kindness results in hitting the sister. You're helping them to think about outward action and the inner life. Then you apply the appropriate consequences.
Every family, you have to figure out exactly what that was. I know in my family growing up, if I lied, it meant getting a visit to the bathroom and having my mouth washed out with soap. I've learned very quickly how to tell the truth. But then after that, whatever that discipline is, you give an opportunity for repentance and asking for forgiveness. And this is a skill you can teach them. And you can say, I'm sorry, will you please forgive me? And you say that to the sister that you punched or to whoever was offended. I'm sorry, will you please forgive? If you ask a question, you wait for it to be answered. And then, then you hug each other, then you forgive, you embrace and you pray blessings on each other.
If you take the time and do this well, it's transformative. It is beneficial. It's life-giving.

It always affects others; it always goes beyond what you deem it will. The consequences reach farther than you ever imagined. And that's what's here in this commandment.

They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the Lord's temple to perform their daily duties according to their divisions.
This reflects a perspective that we find throughout the word of God. In Exodus, Moses said, ""we will all go"", when he's talking to Pharaoh and saying, “Let my people go.” He said some of you can go. He said, no, we will all go, young and old, our sons and daughters, our flocks our herds. We must all join in together in celebrating a festival to the Lord.
Pharaoh was not pleased with that. He replied on that occasion and you can read this an Exodus 10. ""Only the men may go and worship the Lord since that is what you requested"".

If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he's not willing, then as surely as the Lord lives, I will redeem you myself!…
And Boaz, the next day is he meets the other relative that says to the family redeemer, …”You know Naomi, who came back from Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here, in the presence of these witnesses… Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry, Ruth, the Moabite widow.
""Then I can't redeem it,"" the family redeemer replied. You redeem the land. I cannot do it."" …
So Boaz took Ruth into his home. She became his wife. When he slept with her, the Lord enabled her to become pregnant and she gave birth to a son.
And of course, this is a really important family event in the Bible because her descendants lead to king David and ultimately to Jesus. So this is part of the great story of the Bible that impacts all of our families.
Now this principle, this passage 40, embodies what we talked about in the previous one, 39, to not take advantage of someone else's misfortune. See he could, in his position as landowner, he could have just exploited Ruth's services to enrich himself or advantage himself in some way, but he doesn't do so. The levirate laws, those are the laws that had men marry their brothers widows, were there to guard the economic wellbeing of the widows and the future inheritance of those to be born.
So Boaz deals with Ruth in a way that shows responsibility, self-sacrifice, and love. That should characterize all of our family relationships. We should always be reaching out in caring and love.",What can you learn Boaz's care of Ruth and how could you apply that today?,"How would society be different if individuals took more responsibility for members of their family struggling economocially?

And it takes us to key passage 41: David Cares for Mephibosheth. That's a good name to practice. Mephibosheth. 2 Samuel 9:1: One day David asked, ""Is anyone in Saul's family still alive - anyone to whom i can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?""
Now, when he started out that question, ""Is anyone in the Saul's family still alive?"" I imagine everyone thought, “Oh, Saul's family. That's the prior king and his descendants. They're the enemy. They're the ones whose dynasty could rise up in opposition, be a threat to David and his political future. Certainly, he is wanting to find out who they are so he can kill them and rid himself of that security problem.”
But he goes on to say, “Is there anyone in Saul's family still alive? Anyone to whom I can show kindness.” When we understand family, we understand loyalty and biblical love, and how we do relationships. It changes everything. David's unconditional love was counter-cultural and counterintuitive. Mephibosheth would have been considered the crown prince, the next in line to step into his grandfather Saul's or his father Jonathon's place as king. Both had died in battle sometime earlier. He would have been viewed as David's political rival, a threat to his kingdom as he was the point person of the deposed dynasty of Saul. But David had covenanted with Jonathan. And that covenant was like, “I’m going to treat you like family.” This is biblical love.
This was an amazing story. When Jonathan did this with David, Jonathan knew, recognized that God was anointing David. Jonathan was the crown prince. And when he made this relationship with David, he is saying, I'm willing to relinquish my place so that you can be the next king. And when David made this covenant with Jonathan, he was saying, I will consider all of your descendants like my own family. This is a remarkable example of how our love should extend beyond just our nuclear family, into the relationships that God brings into our lives in a transforming way.",Explain why David showed love to Jonathan's crippled son.,When have you received surprising grace from an unexpected source?,,,"After today's learning, what will you pledge to improve?",

Above the Horse Gate, the priests repaired the wall, each one repaired the section immediately across from his own home.
You know the story perhaps. In Nehemiah, Jerusalem's walls have been destroyed. Nehemiah returns to repair the walls and he gets people involved. He motivates them to join with him. And there are teams of people all around the city involved in repairing the walls. And what he does is he asks people whose homes are near the wall to repair the wall by their homes. It's easy to motivate them because that's what you do. You do things to protect your family.

This comes from Mark 7:9-13. Then he said (this is Jesus speaking to the religious leaders of his day) You skillfully sidestep God's law in order to hold onto your own tradition. For instance, Moses gave you this law from God: Honor, your father and mother, and Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father and mother must be put to death.' But you say it is alright for people to say to the parents, 'Sorry, I can't help you, for I vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.' In this way, you let them disregard their needy parents. And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition…
What is more important, your tradition, your culture, your personal convictions, or aligning yourself with the word of God? See, to honor your parents, the fifth commandment of the 10 commandments, did not merely mean to respect them or pay attention to them. It meant to care for them and to provide for them, especially as they advanced in years and were no longer able to care for themselves. If your aged parents were financially destitute and could not provide for themselves and had to live in the streets or in some inappropriate housing situation, it was a responsibility to the children to provide for them. To not do so would be shameful; it is the opposite of honoring to have, it would be dishonoring the parents to allow them who had provided for you in the early years of your life to now be destitute because you're not providing for them.
So what was going on? The religious leaders in Jesus' day were teaching that if you give to a religious cause like to supporting the Levites or the priests or the furnishings of the Temple or anything like that, well, then you were exempt from this obligation. You didn't have to provide your aging parents. They pushed the idea that the church or the temple or the religious institution that they were involved with trumped the family, was more important and made it sound really spiritually. If you do this, you know, giving to support us, oh, I mean giving to God, then you don't have to do this other stuff. That is really not spiritual. It is disobedient. Jesus exposes this for what it is. Disregard for God and disobedience to his word. Taking care of needy parents in the season of life where they have increasing healthcare issues is really important.

As we said earlier, healthcare is an area of shared responsibility. It always begins with family. At later times in life, religion and government and economics all participate. And that's biblical. There was a good basis for that, but it begins with family. The life, health, and wellbeing of every individual is a shared responsibility. Parents are the first ones who carry this.

John 9:1-3. As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. ""Rabbi,"" His disciples asked him, ""why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents' sins?"" ""It was not because of his sins, or his parents' sins,"" Jesus answered. ""This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.
Sometimes when we encounter someone who is sick or has some kind of disease or infirmity or physical dysfunction, we ask, why is this person sick?
I'm going to tell you a story. I have a dear, dear friend in South Africa who got very sick. He had a digestive tract problem, and he was rushed to the hospital and they saved him miraculously, but he had to have a good part of his small intestines cut out to do that. And so it was a long time of recovery.
My wife, Christine, our kids lived very close to his dear family. So we spent the nights in the hospital with him, help babysit their kids so that his wife could be with him. We just surrounded them and supported them as much as we could for several weeks as they were in the recovery mode. During this time, several times, she would get phone calls and people would come and visit her and try to give her some wisdom from God as to why he got so sick. There was a sin in this area or something over there, or some curse, or some spiritual warfare. And one day I was at the house and someone had just called her and said  that she needed to repent: this, that, or the other so that her husband could be well. She put down the phone and was crying.
She came to me and said, ""David, I want to thank you. So many have tried to give us their wisdom. And you've been such a good friend. You have no wisdom to give us at all."" And we've laughed about that over the years, the way that came out. But you know, when someone is sick, we don't always understand the why. And it's usually not helpful to try to pin it on one thing or another. It's an opportunity for God to show up and we just need to be present. That's what you do in family. You're there with people. You hang out with them. You love them. When they're sick, you, you step in and, and you sweep the floors and you do the dishes and you cook the meals that they normally would have done because they are not able to do that. This is what we do. This is what the kingdom looks like. We don't have to have all the answers. We do need to be present and love.
Job's friends were friends the first few days when they came and just sat with him. The moment they started talking it went downhill. They tried to explain to him why he was having these problems. And it’s just like in my story of my friends in South Africa. Their wisdom did not help at all. And God says, “Don't listen to their words.” What we need is an encounter with God in the midst of moments of pain. And what we do as the broader community is come alongside in that way.
Now some health issues are family related. You know, you might have a heart disease that you have a propensity for because your father and your grandfather had it. Or you might have grown up in an alcoholic environment with an alcoholic parent and that produces certain issues in your own life, but not everything is related to family. Some diseases have spiritual origins and some are just physical. We can't always know.

I'm going to read to you some selections from Acts 5:1-10. This is the time of the early church. And there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property. He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife's consent, he kept the rest. Then Peter said, ""Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself. The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, that the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren't lying to us but to God!"" As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified. Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.
About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, ""Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?"" ""Yes,"" she replied, ""that was the price."" And Peter said, ""How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out too.""
Instantly she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
Wow, this is a sober story. Economics and family. Now, to understand this story, you have to understand that just before there is another story of a man named Barnabas who sold his property and gave all of it. No one was requiring him to give it all, but he decided to that. And everyone was so encouraged. Ananias and Sapphire said, “Wow, we'd like to have maybe that same kind of respect and the acclaim that Barnabas had. So let's sell our property, but we'll keep some of it, but we'll say we gave it all.” The problem wasn't the economics. The problem was the lying about it. It was the deception.
So here we have family, economics and religion. They were trying to get religious kudos, you know, like very committed, wonderful people. But God's Spirit knew that when there's economic deception in the family, bad things happen. And so the tragedy is that they had conspired, they had agreed together to lie. It was a joint decision to deceive. So to gain this recognition, status, appreciation. So that's a warning to us.

This comes from 2 Chronicles 25:4. Its speaking in this passage of king Amaziah. However, he [Amaziah] did not kill the children of the assassins, (of his father) for he obeyed the command of the Lord as written by Moses in the book of the Law: ""Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of their parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes.""
So what's the background of this story? Well, Amaziah was the ninth monarch, eighth king, but there was a queen in that line. So the ninth monarch of the Southern kingdom of Judah. His father, Joash of Judah, had begun well, but as later in life had abandoned the Lord. You can see this in 2 Chronicles 24. And he led to a humiliating defeat and ultimately the assassination at the hands of Jozacar and Jehozabad.
Amaziah was crowned as a result to be king at 25 and sought to apply God's laws in the governmental role. Now the cultural custom of course, was to find the assassins, kill them and kill all of the family members. Again, just making sure that as you were taking vengeance on them, there were no survivors who could retaliate. This resulted in an ever escalating cycle of violence and retribution. But Amaziah didn't do what was the cultural standard, what was the cultural norm. He heeded the words of Deuteronomy 24:16, that parents should not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of the parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes. No one else's. So, the children were not guilty. He did something transformative. As king he could have issued the command, he had the power to do so, but he did not exercise that because he knew that even though it was normative, it was not in keeping with God's ways and character.
And so he exercised godly self-control and did not use the governmental powers he had to harm the family members of the guilty assassins.

We read this in Luke 11:27-28. As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, ""God, bless your mother-- the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!"" Jesus replied, ""But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice.""
What is going on? This sounds like a very strange interchange in our 21st century ears. Well, the woman's words reflected the traditional rabbinic position that women receive God's blessing indirectly through they're seeing their menfolk - their sons, their husbands do the work of God because a woman could not serve God in her own right.
So the rabbis have taught, and I quote (this comes from The Mishnah): ""Where might the women earn merit? By making their children go to synagogue to learn the scripture and their husbands to go to the House of Study and waiting for their husbands until they return.""
In this worldview, Mary would have been in blessed above all women, because no woman had ever had a son like Jesus. And, but Jesus said, “This is not God's view. You're not blessed just because you have godly menfolk, you're blessed because of who you are.”
Jesus' response wasn't being dismissive of his mother. On the contrary, throughout his life He lovingly and respectfully addresses her as, “dear woman.” We see that in John 2:4 and 19:26. And he's concerned for her wellbeing. In fact, one of the last things he says on the cross, as he points her to John is to make sure that she's well taken care of. So there's not a problem with his mother.
But Jesus' response is addressing the fact that women are relegated to only being valuable in their role as mothers. That's a valuable role. But when that's the only thing that you have or can do, that is a limitation that God never intended. His words are a categorical rejection of a system of thought, which excludes active participation in the things of God based upon gender. Jesus will have no part in religious values that relegate, exempt, exclude, and limit a person's walk within ministry for God. In his kingdom, blessedness is not gotten through a family member's merit or ministry. Personal obedience to the word of God is the foundation of blessedness.
He doesn't ask if that is male obedience or female obedience. He said, if you hear God's word and you do it, you are blessed.
Culturally determined gender roles are not the basis of Jesus' valuing of people. Hearing and obeying the word of God is His universal standard. It's an equal playing field for all. For all who are obey his word, there's no God-given limit on their God-given destiny.",Are there any times where you have limited God by not obeying when He spoke?

If a family is too small to eat a whole animal, let them share with another family in the neighborhood. Divide the animal according to the size of each family and how much they can eat.

Family is the place where the creativity of this celebration, where the is story is rehearsed and passed on to the next generation. Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sacks does one of the most famous Ted talks that has ever been posted. And he talks about the Passover feast in this way. He says, “Jews have been scattered and dispersed and exiled for 2000 years. We never lost our identity. Why? Because at least once a year on the festival of Passover, we told our story and we taught it to our children and we ate the unleavened bread of affliction and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery. So we never lost our identity. I think collectively, you've got to get back to telling our story, who we are, where we came from, what ideals by which we live. And if that happens, we'll become strong enough to welcome the stranger and say, come and share our lives, share our stories, share our aspirations and dreams.”
