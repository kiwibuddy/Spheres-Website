**Family Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader  
June 2023

**Family Sphere Introduction**  
Family is talked about in the Bible, in every book either directly or indirectly. The Bible talks about it a whole lot. And God is the one who had the original idea of family. In Genesis 2:24, we see that he's the one who instituted marriage at the very beginning of creation. He intended it to be a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman. 

When the original couple expanded into a family with the birth of their first child, we're told in Genesis 4:1, it was with the Lord's help. He's involved in families, right from the very beginning. His purpose for this sphere is that life might be multiplied and that a God given destiny for every individual, may be established. God desires that we engage with families to serve and strengthen them, to see his purposes restored.

In this session we're going to be looking at 52 key passages that talk about the family. God's relationship to a family, beliefs, values, principles, practices about the family. And so we have a perspective from the scriptures, what our families should look like. We should allow the word of God and not our culture to be the ones who determine what we, what we envisioned family to be. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

So we're gonna divide this in several sections. The first one, we're going to look at 10 passages that talk about God in this sphere of family. Family is foundational to society, marriage established by God in Genesis 2 before the fall; this was when everything was good. It's his design for extending his blessings to the nations of the earth.

Family Sphere **1: God is like a Good Father.** 

We take this from 1 John 3:1-2. It says, see what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it does not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God. And what we will be has not yet been made known, but we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him for, we shall see him as he is. 

You know that the Original Testament, it refers to God as father, only 19 times, that might be surprising to you. This was not the common way that the Jewish people spoke of God. It was much too intimate. But when Jesus came on the scene, he addresses God as father 190 times, ten times more than all the Old Testament. And this is was highly unusual.

It was not mindless repetition of cultural verbiage that he was just saying. It was, Jesus was trying to communicate to his audience, that God wants to have an intimate familial relationship with them. Among the Jewish people, they spoke of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the fathers. He was their God. And Jesus wanted to make know that God is our God, like your father. The one who first saw you upon birth and who occasioned conception. He is that close to you. So relational intimacy is supposed to be present reality. He taught us to pray our Father. Our Father. Not just Jesus', but our father because of what Jesus has done.

**Family Sphere 2: God is Like a Good Mother.** 

Isaiah 49:15 says, …Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? But even if that were possible, I would not forget you.

See, family is to be the place of ever present, constant caring and love. It's attentive love. I can't imagine my mom ever having forgotten me. She was always thinking about me and my brothers and sisters. But even if she had, God does not. As you know this, these terms, God is our father. God is mother. These are not gender defining terms. God is above gender; Father and mother are metaphors, that they're the life givers. They're the life protectors. They're the life enhancers. And those are the things that we're supposed to experience in family, when we do it, according to biblical patterns.

**Family Sphere 3: God is a Father to the Fatherless**

Our **third** passage is this. God is a Father to the Fatherless. This comes from Psalm 68:5-6. He said that he is a Father to the fatherless, defender of widows — this is God, whose dwelling is holy. God places the lonely in families…

You know, when we talk about this subject, not everyone lives in an ideal family. Some of you have a lot of pain from your family background. Your family may have been broken, dysfunctional, or just non-existent. Whatever your situation, God is there for you. If you are fatherless, he's there for you. If you're a widow, he's there for you. If you're lonely, he's there for you. God wants to come to re-parent us, to re-family us, to restore us, to take that was not as it should be and create what it ought to have been. That's what coming into the family of God is all about. He fills the void and he makes up for life's brokenness. This is what family is supposed to be like. None of us have a perfect family, but all of us have a perfect God who wants to restore the idea of family and our experience through the way he deals with us.

**Family Sphere 4: God is a Faithful Husband to an Unfaithful People.** 

This concept comes from Hosea 3:1. Then the Lord said to me (this is Hosea the prophet talking) go and love your wife again. Even though she commits adultery with another lover. This will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them. 

Hosea had a very painful life. He was a man of God, he loved God and he loved his wife, but his wife was unfaithful to him. And he thought, what should I do? Should I divorce her? Or should I leave her? And God said keep loving her, because all my people are unfaithful and I keep loving them. Faithful loyalty and unconditional commitment are hallmarks of God's relationships towards us. And they should be the things that characterize the relationship between a husband and wife. It models what family is supposed to be like. God loves us relentlessly. Even when we don't reciprocate. Even when we don't respond in kind, he keeps on loving us. This is remarkable. And this is what family love is supposed to look like. Does it look like that in your family? How can we change it? How can we love more? How we can be imitators of God in our family. This is what we're trying to learn how to do. As we look at this very foundational sphere in our society.

**Family Sphere 5: God Desires to Bless All Families.** 

This is amazing. We find this in Genesis 12:1- 3. This is God's very first statement to Abraham. It says this, the Lord said to Abram, leave your native country, your relatives and your father's family, and go to the land that I will show you. I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous. And you will be a blessing to others. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt. All the families on earth will be blessed through you. 

You know, Abraham is considered the father of faith. He's the one who's kind of the head of the story for Christians and Jews and Muslims alike. And he is a heroic man who knew God And it starts off sounding like God's anti-family. Leave your father, leave your relatives, then we head out to something new. But that sacrifice, his family sacrifice, was intended to bring great blessing to all families. 

Right from the very beginning, in this first statement we see that God's focus is on family. And his purpose is to see families blessed. 

Its interesting in this passage that having blessed families is the foundation for becoming a great nation. By focusing on families as God has, we can see the strategic place for this institution in our societies and our cultures. Are we giving it enough importance? Are we really valuing families? If we don’t, it's if we don't emphasize this sufficiently, we will suffer cultural harm. Our societies will crumble. We'll not be the blessed people God wants us to be. This is not true for just one culture. It's every family on earth, throughout the globe. This is God's purpose. Whatever your culture, whatever your nation, whatever your language, family is to be the foundation for blessing.

**Family Sphere 6: God Chooses Abraham to Train His Children.** 

We read this in Genesis 18:18-19. For Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation. And all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him. I've singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just. Then I will do for Abraham all that I have promised.

Have you ever wondered why did God choose Abraham of all the people? Why him? I mean, he was from a pagan culture, living in a pagan land. Around him was idolatry. Why was Abraham selected? The key here is this phrase here. He says, I have singled him out "so that". Other translations say, "because"; so whether it's "so that" or "because" we get something really key. Its either the reason he's selected him because he's going to train his children or, or the purpose, because he could see that he was going to train his children. So whether it's the reason or the purpose of God's selection, the heart of God's eyes on Abraham was he knew that he was going to live for the next generation. Living for the wellbeing of your children and the next generation, investing in them, pouring yourself into them, equipping them for life. This is what pleases God, this is what draws his attention. So that's someone I want to have. That's what I can choose. I can select. I can use. Let's make the next generation our focus and investment.

**Family Sphere 7: God is Our Home**

I love **seven**: Psalm 90:1 says, God is Our Home. Let me read that passage: Lord, through all the generations you have been our home.

What an amazing statement. Home is the place of security, of identity, of belonging; a destiny shaping place characterized by acceptance. A place where we're surrounded by a supportive and loving environment. This is what God is to us. We've been drawn into the Trinitarian family, into the Godhead \-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They've included us in their circle of love, an unbroken, indescribable love, and they've made us family. His family. Adopting us into that intimacy of relationship. When we walk with the Father, with the Son and with the Spirit, we are home.

**Family Sphere 8: God First. All Else Second.** 

This comes from Genesis 22:1-18. I'm going to read just a few selections from this passage. But this is the story of when God asked Abraham to take his son, Isaac who's 12 years old, and offer him up as a sacrifice. And at the last moment, God stops his hand and Isaac is saved and a ram is sacrificed in his place. The place where this happened was Mount Moriah, a place which would later be where the temple was built. And later near when Jesus died. 

"Don't lay a hand on the boy," the angel said, "do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God, you have not withheld from Me even your son, your only son. 

(And that phrase, I just had interrupted reading to say, it certainly sounds like God's son. God's only son who actually went through and gave his life for us in the very near proximity to this place.) 

The angel went on to say, …because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear, by my own name that I will certainly bless you. I will multiply your descendants beyond numbers like the stars of the sky, the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies. And through your descendants, all the nations of the earth will be blessed — all because you have obeyed me.

You know, sometimes you hear people say with good intention: God first, family second, and ministry, or work or professional vocation that comes third. Though it is well intentioned, this is not biblical. The biblical story is simply this: God first. Period. Everything else, you'd have to listen to God.You have to hear and obey. And at times you, you make sacrifices. You, you relinquish a promotion in your workplace because your family needs you more at home at that time. And other times, as a family, you choose to make a sacrifice to accomplish some task that is needful, but you don't make an idol of either family or ministry work or your vocation. 

Both were given by God, to Adam, in Genesis two. God gave Adam a job actually gave him two jobs. One to tend to the garden, that’s a production job, an agricultural gardening job. He also gave him a scientific research job to name the animals, to classify them and give them the appropriate nomenclature. So he was actually given two jobs. And then in the process of doing that, it became apparent that he needed help. And so, God also gave him a wife.

All of this is before the Fall and all needed to be yielded to God. God is the giver of the vocation. God is the giver of the spouse and everything we do is yielded in obedience to him.  When we've set our hearts to hear and obey God, we know when to focus on family and when to prioritize ministry. God will lead you as you listen to him.

**Family Sphere 9: We Will Serve the Lord.** 

Joshua 24:15. At the end of Joshua's remarkable long life he looks back on all the years that he walked with Moses, and the 40 years after that, and he says, challenged the people about their loyalty, will they serve God or will they serve idols? And he goes through a long discourse that his concluding speech ends up with his famous statement, whatever you decide. This is my choice. … as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord. 

Serving God should not only be an individual activity. It should be a family activity. We do this corporately. We do this together and we can't make choices for one another, but we can choose together to, as a family serve and follow and honor God.

**Family Sphere 10: Fight For Your Family.** 

This comes from Nehemiah 4:13-14. So I placed armed guards behind the lowest parts of the wall and exposed areas. I stationed the people to stand guard by families armed with sword, spears, and bows. And as I looked over the situation I called together the nobles and the rest of the people and said to them, don't be afraid of the enemy. Remember the Lord who was great and glorious and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes. 

This is a story for their rebuilding the wall around Jerusalem after returning from exile. And it was a precarious situation. And everyone was tasked to build that part of the wall that was nearest to their home. That was the motivation. We create security and we protect our families. And so that's why they did the construction. But at some times the construction was interrupted because enemies try to come over those half-built walls. And so they had to take a very active posture. It's worth fighting for your family. Family is valuable. Families are treasure. We need to honor it. We need to keep it. We need to protect it.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

This next section we're going to look at is about biblical principles for husbands and wives. It involves 12 different passages. And this really is the heart of family. It is the volitional part. You can't choose your parents, but you do choose your spouse. And, so when you, that choice is a choice to love, a choice to give yourself in service and caring for someone else. And that choice to love is the foundation for family. It's the beginning of family. It really is the heart of family. So let's look at this.

**Family Sphere 11: God Creates Eve and Institutes Marriage.** 

We read this in Genesis 2:18,21-25. Here are a few selections. Then the Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him."... Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib, and he brought her to the man. "At last\!" the man exclaimed. "This one is bone from my bone and flesh from my flesh\! She will be called 'woman' because she was taken from 'man.'" This explains why a man leaves his father and mother, and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one...

There's several things here that need to be said because we, in many of our cultures, we have distorted views on gender and the roles between men and women. Some have said, well, the Bible teaches that man, Adam was created first and then woman. So man is definitely superior, should always be in first place. They missed the point. Before Adam was created, donkeys and frogs were. So if first means more valuable then frogs hit the top of the list. Seemed like God was always going from good to better to best. In fact, the only time, the whole creation story of chapters one and two that God says something was not good is after he made Adam and before he had made Eve. And when they were both together, he said it was very good. Go figure. Okay.

The other thing that is often misunderstood, he says, I will make a helper. Like when we think helper, we kind of think of like maybe an office assistant someone who is not as important as the boss. But that's not what the Bible is talking about. 

Think about it this way. When you were having struggles with math in school and you were coming up to a big test and you needed someone to help you, who did you look for among your classmates? The smartest person or the dumbest person to help you? The smartest, right? You wanted good help, not lousy help.

Or perhaps you are very scrawny and weak and bully of the school would beat you up on the way home from school every day. And you needed some help. Who do you find? Someone as scrawny and weak as you or someone big and strong? Of course, you look for the smart one and you look for the strong one. That's the kind of help we look for.

This Hebrew word for helper is **'ezer.** It's found 21 times in the Old Testament. A couple of times is used for an ally, like a military army. Like Israel went down to Egypt and formed an ally, so they would help them against an invading force. And they did that because they saw they had capacity that they didn't have. But that's just a few times. And except for this one instance, that's the only time it's just one individual. Every other time is talked about God. Where does my help come from? Where does my '**ezer** come from? My help, my **'ezer** comes from the Lord. And he is our  **‘eban azer**, the one who's helped us up to this point. So this is a very strong word. It literally means a strong savior. 

So woman is to be highly valued, highly regarded. And when Adam sees her for the first time he breaks into poetry. It is the first poetic literature in the Bible. Bone from my bone and flesh from my flesh. She is to be a full companion that that comes from his side, not from the bones from his feet so he can step on her or from her brain so she can dominate over him. They'll be side by side together in life. And God institutes marriage as supposed to be always together for all time.

**Family Sphere 12: Ideal Marriage Pattern is Given to Priests.** 

We read about this in Leviticus 21:7, 13-15. Here's some selections. Priests may not marry a woman defiled by prostitution, and they may not marry a woman who's divorced from her husband, for the priests are set apart as holy to their God… The high priest may marry only a virgin. He may not marry a widow, a woman who's divorced, or a woman who defiles herself by prostitution. She must be a virgin from her, his own clan so that he will not dishonor his descendants among his clan for, I am the Lord who makes him holy.

Now this is an interesting passage because we don't find any place in the Bible where it says to all people, you can only marry a virgin. So people said, well, see, premarital sex is okay. That's not the case. This is given to the priest and the high priest as who are the ideal within the culture of how you should live. They are the most, to live the most righteously the most holy way. That's the word that this finishes off. The ideal is stated in hopes that as people aspire toward, it becomes normative. It is the best, what people aspire to. This is the ultimate, the most desirable form of marriage. It's not imposed on all, but given as a dream to inspire all, to shoot high, to shoot this standard so that we would all walk with great integrity in our marriage and our life up to our marriage. 

Now at the same time, God knows there's a lot of brokenness in the world. So there are lots of stories of redemption in the Bible. When we didn't live up to the dream, when we failed. When we did things that we ought not to have done, and our dreams have been broken. We have a story of a God who comes to rewrite our story because he's a Redeemer.

**Family Sphere 13\. Marriage Is to Be Celebrated.** 

This comes from Song of Solomon 5:1. I have entered my garden, my treasure, my bride\! I gather myrrh with my spices and eat honeycomb with my honey. I drink wine with my milk.

Sex in the Bible. Yes, for some it's surprising to find a poem of love and sexual intimacy included in the Bible. What should we be make of it? Some suggest that we should read it only symbolically as a picture of God's unconditional love for his people. Others suggest that it is best understood as a marriage handbook and find the treasure of marital delights in it.

Perhaps there's value in both approaches. At any rate. Song of Songs is a beautiful picture of the physical side of love and its appropriate expression within the bonds of marriage, as part of God's wonderful creation.

You know, this book is a literary drama, not to be acted out, but orally recited, to speak to the hearers of the virtue, wonder and beauty of marriage. But it warns, it advises those who are listening to this dramatic presentation of how special the singular love of one man with one woman is.

Sometimes the translations say that this song was written by Solomon, but actually that would be, was written for Solomon. Because it talked about Solomon's wedding with 60 in chapter three, with 60 Queens. Maybe this was a court jester who wrote this. Who, seeing the trend that was going on in Solomon's life, and what about the one special one, And all the queens are saying it's better to have just one than many of us. Maybe its his way to exhort Solomon to stop his reckless addition of more and more wives to his harem. And to emphasize the beauty of God's original design of one man, one woman. Unfortunately, if that was the case, we can only speculate there. Solomon did not heed. Went on to have 300 wives and 700 concubines, not an example for marriage.

This drama takes us to the longing of the lovers in courtship of chapter 1- 3:5; and then to a wedding scene in chapter 3:6-11. Finally the honeymoon, chapter four, all the way through 5:2 and including this passage that we just read; followed by married life and from 5:3-8:7; and final exhortation to sexual purity before marriage from chapter eight to end. This is a book that should be guiding you in how you live your life in purity as a family.

**Family Sphere 14: Marriage Is To Be Honored.** 

Hebrews 13:4. Marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.

Honored means value. It's what is desired. Many of our cultures celebrate premarital and extramarital sex. That's what the movies and novels are made about. And they make crude jokes about the poor guy who gets married. It portrayed life with your wife or your husband as miserable. This perspective needs to be changed in our cultures. 

You know, we all have slang terms. Like you get married in English you say "you're hooked". That's, that's not very appealing. It sounds like you're trapped and you're ensnared, and you can't get out. In Spanish the word for wife, "**esposa"** also means handcuffs. Not a very good symbolism. We need to change the way we think about it. Do you really honor, in your culture, marriage?

**Family Sphere 15: God's Household Code.** 

This is Ephesians 5:21- 6:9. Going to read just a few selections at the very end of this part. Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives and husbands. Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself. And the wife must respect her husband. Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. Fathers do not exasperate your children instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ and masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Since you know that he was both their master, is in heaven. And there was no favoritism with him.

You know if you treat your slave in the same way that you expect the slave to treat you, he's no longer a slave and you're no longer a master. You're equals. You're brothers. And this is the point. In Ephesians, Paul writes — sit, walk, stand is an easy way to think of it. The first three chapters how we're seated in heavenly places. And chapter 4-6:9 is how we walk out our Christian life. And then 6:10 to the end is about how we stand and the spiritual warfare against the enemy. 

And this middle part, this walk, the Greek word is **peripateo**, and it can mean walk or live. It's used five times. In 4:1 is walk worthy of the calling or live worthy of the calling. And 4:17 is walk not as Gentiles; 5:1 is walk in love; and 5:8 is walk in the light; and 5:15 is walk carefully or walk with wisdom. Be careful how you walk, be careful how you live. It goes on and says, the way we do this is not by being filled with wine, but being filled with the Spirit.

And then it tells you various ways of how to be filled with the Spirit, like singing and making music and praising God. And then, surprisingly \- this was a very long sentence in Greek \- he goes on —the final way of how you know that you've been filled with the Spirit is that you're submitting to one another. 

This mutuality is the foundation that then spills over into the three pairs: husband \-wife, parent-child, and master-slave. And this is revolutionary because in that culture, those weren't mutual relationships, they were hierarchical relationships, and Paul is changing that so that we care for each other. And we recognize the value of each individual. And we break down the dividing walls. Paul uses languages for this culture. Greek and Roman law, even Jewish laws, extra biblical laws, rabbinic laws had requirements for the husband, father, master and others for the wife, the children and the slave. But Paul levels the playing field here in an amazing way.

**Family Sphere 16: Mutuality in Marriage.** 

1Corinthians 7:2-34. Here's some selections. This builds on the same idea that Paul had, of how we come together as equals in the marriage relationship. He says this, the husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife. And likewise, the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but yields to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but yields it to his wife. A wife must not separate from her husband and a husband must not divorce his wife. A married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife. A married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please, her husband.

I've just read four of ten different parallel statements that are found in this chapter, linking husbands and wives. Paul presents a picture of marriage that is extraordinarily startling in its simplicity and its unrelenting equity. In this picture, he portrays a radical reciprocity going back and forth of rights and responsibilities that totally dismantles any cultural double standard. 

When we're talking about discipling nations, double standards destroy people. It creates injustice and brokenness and pain. No longer is gender the great divide. Paul levels the playing field, applying the truth of the cross to the gender issue, finding common ground. He does this by speaking to both men and women in equal terms, sometimes addressing the men first. Sometimes the women. Sometimes both together. What is spoken to one partner is similarly and consistently addressed to the other, creating a seamless symmetry of obligations and expectations.

**Family Sphere 17: Drink From Your Own Well.** 

This is Proverbs 5:15- 23 \- Drink water from your own well \-- share your love only with your wife. Why spill the water of your springs in the streets, having sex with just anyone? You should reserve it for yourselves. Never share it with strangers. Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. She is a loving deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you always. May you always be captivated by her love. Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman, or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman?…

Okay. This is pretty clear. Don't need to expand on this very much. Don't mess around. Be true to your wife. Be true to your husband.

**Family Sphere 18: No Adultery.** 

Deuteronomy 5:18 from the 10 commandments. You can also find this in Exodus 20\. This is commandment  seven. You shall not commit adultery.

You know, adultery is really a matter of the heart. In the Torah, the 10 commandments in both of the Exodus and Deuteronomy versions, is more about a classroom than it is about a courtroom. The word "torah", which is often translated "law", it has is more of the idea of teaching. I want to understand what's right. We should value what is right, so we make it into law and we should do what is right. We should live holy lives. 

Teaching, in the process of teaching you are always moving from external to internal, from concrete to abstract. As we grow, as we mature, we understand not just the rules, but the why behind the rules. And Jesus understands this and he takes this as necessary conclusion. Jesus follows the implication implicit in the command here Deuteronomy five.

And in the sermon on the Mount He says this, "You've heard the commandment that says you must not commit adultery. But I say anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

Now, you might sit there and say, well, I've never had sex with another man's wife. That's notable. But, probably no one who's an adult can say, I've never had a lustful thought. We all are in need of a change at a heart level. We're not talking here, when we're talking about transformation in society, we can't change the externals without changing the internal. And we can't do that by ourselves. That's why Jesus comes. He comes to transform us inside out so that the thoughts of our minds and the motivations of our hearts are changed. So that those of us who are not innocent or have guilt can be forgiven and transformed. As we learn to walk in heart level marital loyalty.

**Family Sphere 19: (David Repents of Adultery)**

follows up on this. David Repents of Adultery. Psalm 51. All the whole psalm is about this; here are a few selections. Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins… Purify me from my sins, and I will be clean. Wash me and I will be whiter than snow… Don't keep looking at my sins. Remove the stain of my guilt. Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a loyal spirit within me… Restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you… You do not desire a sacrifice or I would offer one. You do not want a burnt offering. The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit. You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God…

David wrote this psalm after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba and to cover that one sin, he committed another sin. He arranged for her husband to be killed on the battlefield. This husband had been a loyal friend and supporter, one of David's Mighty Men from the very beginning of his journey, even before he was king. This was such a grievous act of disloyalty, disloyalty to God, to friend, to the way things should be done. And, he didn't recognize it as such until Nathan the prophet came and told the story of a man who had many sheep and a neighbor had only one sheep. And he had guests that came in and, he don't want to kill one of his sheep. So he grabbed his neighbor's one sheep killed that sheep to offer a meal to the guests in hospitality.

And David got angry when he heard this, how could this be? And Nathan said, "You're the man\!" And David quickly repented. He understood what was being said. He realized he had done grave wrong. And this gives us all hope. We don't live flawless lives. If we learn to be like David and be quick to repent, quick to turn, there is hope of redemption. 

Acts 13:22 quotes 1 Samuel 13\. And still considering that David was a man after God's own heart. He had fallen in some very bad sins. This was not praiseworthy at all. But the quickness to repent, the fact that he did not cover up, that he came out and was straightforward, and he says "Create in me a clean heart. Renew a loyal spirit within me", allowed God to forgive him. So we have to come if we have failed in these areas, if we failed in loyalty to family members, we have to seek God with a broken and repentant heart like David did. Broken means that you really embrace the sorrow, the grief of what you've done and repentant means that you've made the determination with God's help to change. You want to live a different life. You're not going the same way. You're going to be a different person from this moment onward. So, broken and repentant heart changes family dynamics.

**Family Sphere 20: The Destructive Legacy of Polygamy.** 

In 2 Chronicles 11:18- 21, we read: Rehoboam married his cousin, Mahalath, the daughter of David's son Jerimoth... Later Rehoboam married another cousin, Maacah, the granddaughter of Absalom... Rehoboam loved Maacah more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had 18 wives and 60 concubines. And they gave birth to 28 sons and 60 daughters.

Wow. There was a lot of lack of self-control in Rehoboam's life, but it wasn't as bad as his father Solomon. But he learned from his father Solomon, how did not reign in his, his lust for pleasure. And Rehoboam's leadership and this lack of self control in this area had grave effects on the whole nation.

What do you do in your family impacts culture. What do you do in your family impacts how you do your job. What Rehoboam did with family altered the history of Israel. His lack of self control with his wives and with money and taxes and several things \- it's this spirit- led to people rising up against him. …The kingdom was split into two and it was a, it was a terrible moment of history. For the next 400 years. There'd be wars and cruelty and oppression and conflict. Who knows how many untold numbers of people suffering? Because one man did not know how to exercise self control and his family relationships and the implications that that had on the whole nation.

**Family Sphere 21: Marriage and the Resurrection.** 

This comes from Mark 12:18-27. Here's some selections. Jesus was approached by some Sadducees — religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on his brother's name. Well suppose there were seven brothers...

And they spin this yarn out. His brother marries a woman. He dies, and so the next brother marries her and he dies, and successively, until all seven have had the same woman. Now this is laughable in their culture because it was allowable for man to have multiple wives, but not for a woman to have multiple husbands. But the question was, and I continue with the passage , "whose wife will she be in the resurrection?"

This seems so ludicrous. It was like, they're saying, obviously God would not allow that to happen. So there can't be any resurrection. "Well, all seven of our marriage to her." Jesus replied, "Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures and you don't know the power of God. For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage… But now, as to whether the dead will be raised haven't you read …He’s the God of the living, not of the dead."

Now, how Jesus does that is that he talks about that God is the God of Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob. And the scriptures say that after Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are dead. And because it says "he is" in present tense, he says, he's not the God of the the dead, but of the living. So that means Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive.

So he exposed their double standard on marriage and exposed their ignorance of God and the Scriptures and His ways. It's important to understand though, that it says that neither marry, they won't be married or being given in marriage in heaven, doesn't mean that there's not family. There's not new marriages. The only wedding ceremony and is there in heaven is the marriage feast of the lamb. The family will still be recognized in heaven. And in this very passage, he talks about family dynamics, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They're a family… Our choices here, the relationships will last beyond this life.

**Family Sphere 22: God Hates Divorce.** 

Malachi 2:14-16. You cry out, "Why doesn't the Lord accept my worship?" I'll tell you why\! Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young. But you have been unfaithful to her. Though she remained your faithful partner, the wife of your marriage vows. 

Didn't the Lord make you one with your wife? In body and spirit you are his. And what does he want? Godly children from your union. So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth. "For I hate divorce\!" says the Lord, the God of Israel. "To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "So guard your heart, do not be unfaithful to your wife."

It's important to know that God, it says here that God hates divorce. He hates broken relationships. He hates broken commandments. He hates disloyalty. It doesn't say he hates people who have been divorced. He loves people, he hates those things that, that are destructive to relationships and that wound people. 

This passage urges the husband to be faithful to his wife. And it says this amazing phrase that being unfaithful to your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty. Unfaithfulness is a cruel thing, that just overwhelms emotions, overwhelms the psyche, overwhelms the spirit. Twice it says this passage guard your heart. Once again we see its not so much about the external things. Those are important. But the place for the external problems are birthed is in the heart. Proverbs 4:23 says a similar thing. It says, Guard your heart above all else for it determines the course of your life.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

This next section of scripture is 15 passages about biblical principles for parents and children. This is when the marriage bears fruit and you start seeing the next generation of family emerge. 

**Family Sphere 23: Children Are a Gift From God.**

So we'll begin with our 23rd key passage. Children Are a Gift from God, Psalm 127:3-5. Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warrior's hands. How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them\! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.

This is really important passage for many in our world today, because many see children as a burden, as a risk, as something that keeps you from doing what you really want to do, your profession, your vocation, they're costly- too much money, and they limit your freedom. Uh, these are these thoughts are a result of a humanistic worldview, which sees virtue as me experiencing maximum personal individual fulfillment. 

We're called to invest the lives of others. And there's nothing greater, greater joy, a greater destiny, a greater legacy, than investing in the life of the next generation of children. Children should not be seen as a pain or problem. The world is designed for many people, billions more than currently are alive to be sustainable. There's not a population problem. There's a love problem. We don't love enough. We don't care enough. They're not a burden. They're a blessing.

It's interesting that this passage uses the language of arrows. An arrow is shaped as you got, you know, the arrowhead, the shaft and has to just be straight and the feathers at the end, which helped guide it in balance and flight. The arrow was designed that you keep it in your quiver for some time. It's purpose is to not to stay in the quiver, but to be fitted to a bow and launched to a great distance and to accomplish something that will benefit and protect the family. And that is, that is an important thought that we as parents are to be shapers of the children as someone who manufactures the arrow. So they will fly straight. They will fly true. They will fly far and they will be effective in what they're called to do.

**Family Sphere 24: We are Handmade by God.** 

Psalm 139:13-16. You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex\! Your workmanship is marvelous —how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion. As I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born…

Friends, we know that you and I came to life because at one point, your father and mother, as was in the case, my father, my mother were joined sexually. And the two cells came together and conception happened. But who you are, who I am, who each one of us is, is so much more than the biology and the DNA of those two cells. You have a unique fingerprints and mother nature doesn’t do that. The Creator God, the Father of the universe, is the one who does that. 

Nature just takes existing DNA and blends it. It doesn't do something new or innovative. If you cross a red rose with a yellow rose, you're going to have a red rose with the yellow edge around it. It was going to be a yellow rose with red flecks on it, or maybe orange-ish, but you're never going to have a purple rose. It can't do something unique. It just takes and re-blends, repackages what is, and you are unique. Your fingerprints are unique. Your retina prints are unique. Your voice prints are unique. Your walk is unique. Your face is unique. Everything about you is unique. There's not another copy like you. And beyond those physical elements, the talents, the gifts- who you are- that's unique.

And that's because you're a combination, both your parents physical union, and God's spiritual intervention. Just like when he made Adam from dirt, he breathed on him and in the dirt was all the chemical stuff, all the DNA, all the prime material, all the raw material, everything that was needed, but he wasn't a living soul until God breathed on him. When those two cells come together God breathes on you and makes you, you. You're handmade by God. And that is good news. 

Maybe you weren't especially loved as a child. Maybe you're a girl and your father wanted a boy, or maybe it was just the opposite. You're a boy and your mom wanted a girl. And for whatever reason, you may not have been celebrated as greatly as you should have been in your life. But God did. You are not a mistake. You're not an accident. You are purposely handmade by God and you are special. And he cares for you.

**Family Sphere 25: Children are Born with God's Help.** 

Genesis 4:1. Now Adam has sexual relations with his wife, Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said, "With the Lord's help, I have produced a man."

Just as in the previous section, we recognize that new life is both an act of a man and a woman coming together and also an act of God. Eve with the birth of the first human baby recognizes that's only possible with God's help. He intervened. He's a part of the story. So we should always give God the glory and focus on that.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

The next two are passages about the longing for children. When we don't have them. Many, there are many couples who would love to have children and don't have one. The scriptures understand their story. Talks about people like that. The first one was a father who wanted a child. The second story is a mother who wanted a child.

**Family Sphere 26: Abraham Cries Out for an Heir.** 

Genesis 15:1-6. …Abraham replied, "O Sovereign Lord what good all your blessings when I don't even have a son? Since you've given me no children, Eliezer of Damascus, a servant in my household will inherit all my wealth. You've given me no descendants of my own, so one of my servants will be my heir."

Then the Lord said to him, "No, your servant will not be your heir, for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir." Then the Lord took Abram outside and said to him, "Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you will have\!"

This is a remarkable story. And it portrays God's relationship with Abraham in a very intimate way. They're having this conversation like you would chat with your friend. It's not like a vision or a thought patterns. There, this is some kind of encounter with the living God. It's very tangible. Right in the middle of the story when they're talking about this, it says the Lord took Abraham outside. What was that like? Outside? Well it means that they were inside. Where? Probably the tent. He was a nomad, he cared for sheep. Abraham, it was his tent. He would have been the host. Also, if they're talking inside the tent, he would've ... God said, "Let's go outside," and he probably would have opened the flap and they would duck their heads together. Did God hold him by the shoulder, put his arm around him, take it by the hand? How did God take him outside?

This is, you have got to put yourself in scene. God's really involved. He really cares. He is there. And He says, "look up to the sky". Abram wanted one son. He wanted a nine month miracle. God spoke of many, many descendants, not just one generation, but many generations afterwards that would be more than the stars of the sky. Millions upon millions upon millions. God sees your desire and he has bigger dreams for you than you have for yourself. His dreams for family that will touch the nations of the world. And that's what he had for Abraham. And that's what he has for you.

**(Family Sphere 27: Hannah Prays For a Son.)**

The second story in this spirit is from 1 Samuel 1:10-11. numbers 27, Hannah Prays for a Son. "Hannah was in deep anguish, crying bitterly as she prayed to the Lord. And she made this vow: "O Lord of Heaven's Armies, if you look upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son, then I will give him back to you. He'll be yours for his entire lifetime, and as a sign that he has been dedicated to the Lord, his hair will never be cut."

She had long wanted to have a son, a child, and didn't have any. She prayed desperately. God heard her. And not too long thereafter, she became pregnant. And Samuel was born. Samuel was a remarkable prophet priest who served God and was used by God to both anoint Saul, the first king of Israel and David, the second king. And, what we need to understand that God hears the longing of the heart, of a want to be mother, of a want to be father because he knows how valuable life is. God is a life giver and he celebrates people who want to be life givers too. When you want to give life to someone else you are identifying with a basic aspect of God's character and he's for you. He'll be with you. He will help you.

**Family Sphere 28: Genealogies Tell the Story of Life.** 

I'm going to read the first three verses of 1Chronicles 1\. It goes like this: The descendants of Adam were Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah…

Those are the first three verses. And for the next nine chapters, you have verse after verse after verse of one name after another. If you're like me, you're probably, when you get to this part of the Bible, you're probably just tempted to just skip over it. I mean, most people most verses have three or four or five names, per verse. That is almost "perverse” to have so many names in such a concentrated place. But really why are, why is this long genealogy there? Why are there so many genealogies throughout the Bible? They're telling family stories, family lines. You know, speaking of legacy, of roots, of identity, of belonging, of heritage, these things are important. They shape us. When we lose our roots, when we forget where we come from, we no longer have a perspective as to where we were going. So God honors family and these many genealogies throughout the scriptures, are ways of telling the story of life. Life happens through the interactions of family and through the fruitfulness and multiplication that comes through marriage.

**Family Sphere 29: God Understands Aaron's Parental Concerns.** 

I'm going to read from Leviticus 10:19-20 \- Then Aaron answered Moses, "Today my sons presented both their sin offering and their burnt offering to the Lord. And yet this tragedy has happened to me. If I had eaten the people's sin offering on such a tragic day as this, would the Lord have been pleased? And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied.

Now this is a, what is going on? What is the story about? In Leviticus, God is setting the rules of what, how to do religion. What kind of sacrifices and offerings to make and the role of the priests. And there are requirements on the priestly family that are not on the general population. And one of the things is that, they are supposed to treat the offerings with great respect. People bring the offerings and, at great sacrifice and they're not to use it for any personal way. And on this particular day, his two eldest sons, did not follow the instructions and fire fell and consumed them both. And he had to carry on and keep doing his work as a priest, even though there wa great family pain.

Now this is the heart of the levitical account of God's concern with justice and holiness. And there is a really important discovery to be made. If you read the book of Leviticus in the SourceView format that you'll find where we have all the SphereView text, this book is almost all red, God's words with some few black passages of the narrator and every now and then a couple green words from Moses. The only blue text, the only time someone other than Moses or God speaks in this book is this little phrase right here, where Aaron, he keeps performing his service, but he can't bring himself to eat the sacrifice that he's supposed to because he's mourning the loss of his son. And so Moses said, "Why aren't you following the rules? You know, you're supposed to do this." And Aaron says, "You know, please Moses, my brother, you know, just show mercy to me. My sons they are grieving because of the death of their brothers."

God who so carefully had laid out the rules for the priesthood, readily understands and extends family compassion to him. This visual statement, the only blue text in this whole book of the Bible, adds to the picture that God is willing to make compassionate exceptions for family needs. Wow, this brings relational clarity and mercy into play as family and religion intersect.

**Family Sphere 30: Honor your Father and Mother.** 

Deuteronomy 5:16. This is the fifth commandment. And it says this: Honor your father and mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land The Lord your God is giving you.

Why should we honor father and mother? Really why? Maybe you've got great parents. Maybe you have bad parents. Maybe your father abused you. Maybe your mother abandoned you. Maybe they're idolaters or worshipers of false gods. Are you supposed to honor them? There's no qualification on this passage. It doesn't say honor your father and mother if they're nice people. It says, full-stop. Why? Why? No matter what they did in their life after they gave birth to you, they gave you the greatest gift that you have. They gave you life. Because they are life givers, like God is a life giver, you are to honor them. It doesn't mean that you always obey them, but you have a great respect and gratitude and appreciation for them. Even though they may have done many wrong things after that time, you may need to be forgiving them and doing other things, but God honors life givers. And so should we.

And when we realize that life is the greatest gift, everything follows. Once you honor your father and mother, you can't kill somebody else. If you honor life-giver, you can't be a life-taker. And that's commandment six. And if you honor your father and mother, you really aren't going to be inclined to commit adultery. Because even though that's not taking someone's life, physically its taking the most special thing in someone's life relationally, emotionally. And if you're honoring your father and mother not only to protect other people's lives and be true to your marital vows, but you're not going to be a thief.

Well, why not be a thief? Well, because there's those inanimate things that have nothing to do with life. Well, if I buy a television, I have to work so many hours at so many dollars an hour to be able save up enough money to buy that television. So that television isn't all of my life. So it's not like murder or the best thing in my life like my wife, but it represents weeks or maybe months of my labor so it's part of my life. That's why things are valuable \- because they represent human life. That's why airplanes cost more than pencils. More human life goes into building an airplane. than goes into building a pencil. We value the life that has been invested. And so you can see once you take this principle of recognizing that life is the greatest gift, we are to be people who love life, who champion life, who celebrate life, who protect life, who guard life, who honor life and honor life givers and all these other laws follow.

**Family Sphere 31: Listen to Your Parents' Instructions.** 

Proverbs 1:8. My child, listen when your father corrects you, don't neglect your mother's instructions.

I know that if you are like me, there are times growing up when your dad was talking to you and you just tuned out, right? You on the outside, you were nodding your head looking obedient, but inside you're thinking, I am gonna do whatever I want to do. Not a desirable thing to do. The word here, for listen, is **Shema.** It's the same word that is used when it says, Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul and strength. Hear O Israel, **Shema** Israel. This word **Shema** means to both listen and obey. It's, it's not just like the going in one ear; you're hearing with an intent to apply.There's an old English word that we don't use very much. It's the word ‘heed’. It means to listen and implement what you hear; to walk it out. And that's what we need to do. 

Now, parents you use that wisely. And the way you instruct and give instructions to a five-year-old is different than a 15 year old or very different from 25 year-old. So this to children: we learn by obeying, and then we grow in our understanding and the rules that are given to us become internalized principles and the instruction that we receive from our parents become patterns that we walk in, because we have those self control mechanisms on the inside. That's what parenting is all about. This is your biggest discipleship opportunity in your life to invest in that next generation and children to learn and grow from your parents.

**Family Sphere 32: Discipline Your Children with Love.** 

Proverbs 3:11-12. My child, don't reject the Lord's discipline and don't be upset when he corrects you. For the Lord corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.

So when we correct as parents, we should do it in love, not in anger. And you need to do that very consistently. There's a process of that. We learned as young parents in our own family, that there's several steps in your disciplining of a child. Remember, you're not just taking out your emotions. No, that's not helpful. You're discipling them in the way they should go. So when, when there has been disobedience, when they have done something dangerous or wrong, something unkind, you get, you first get control of your own emotions and you sit with them and you help talk through and help them understand what was wrong. Make it clear you did this, you described the action and then help them define the motive behind that. I hit my sister and that was not kind. So, lack of kindness results in hitting the sister. You're helping them to think about outward action and the inner life. Then you apply the appropriate consequences. 

Every family, you have to figure out exactly what that was. I know in my family growing up, if I lied, it meant getting a visit to the bathroom and having my mouth washed out with soap. I've learned very quickly how to tell the truth. But then after that, whatever that discipline is, you give an opportunity for repentance and asking for forgiveness. And this is a skill you can teach them. And you can say, I'm sorry, will you please forgive me? And you say that to the sister that you punched or to whoever was offended. I'm sorry, will you please forgive? If you make a question, you wait for it to be answered. And then, then you hug each other, then you forgive, you embrace and you pray blessings on each other. 

If you take the time and do this well, it's transformative. It is beneficial. It is, uh, it's life giving. And what is, uh, a moment of brokenness, the moment of disobedience, the moment of, the bad activity can be turned into something redemptive. And it's a full-time job, mom and dad. It’s, there are no holidays. And so you could just hang on for grace, you hold onto the Lord, but you discipline your children because you love them. That's what God does with us. That's what we need to do with our children.

**Family Sphere 33: Multi-generational Accountability.** 

Deuteronomy 29:29 says this, The Lord our God has secrets known to no one. We are not accountable for them, but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed to us, so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions.

We and our children. Now, the way your children are going to be accountable is because you're faithful in passing on God's revelation to the next generation. That's our responsibility as parents. We must train them. You must impart to them the truth, the insight. Parents are that the primary responsibility in the education, the development, the training, the teaching of their children. And we must pass on and not hold stories back. Tell stories of when you've done things well, tell stories of when you blown it.

All these stories are found in the Bible. We have records of people doing great victories and totally messing up. And we learned from all those stories, what to imitate, what to avoid. But pass on your stories, pass on the stories of scripture. Pass on the word of God. Make sure that we all know because we'll be held accountable, every generation.

**Family Sphere 34: Multi-generational Consequences.** 

Also from the book of Deuteronomy 5:8-10. You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image of anything in the heavens or the earth or in the sea. You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected \--- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love me and obey my commands.

You know, when we sin, sin is very deceptive and we rationalize a lot. And we usually think I'm an adult. I can choose this. It'll only affect me. It never affects only you. It always affects others; it always goes beyond what you deem it will. The consequences reach farther than you ever imagined. And that's what's here in this commandment. This understanding that sin and righteousness will affect not only you, but your children and your grandchildren and your great or great, great grandchildren to the third and fourth generation. Wow. So we're up. Take these things seriously. There are consequences and we want to live in our family in such a way that we're enhancing their future, not creating roadblocks in their future or placing landmines in the pathway before them because of the things that we have done. So let's be quick to acknowledge our sin and repent and return from that and lead our children in that same way.

This is a wonderful way. This is translated here. It says the entire family is affected. There's nothing you do that is private or individual. Even if you do it by yourself, in your room alone at night, it affects the entire family. Entire families affected by idolatry by having anything other than God as a thing that you are following in your life. 

But here's an encouraging thing. If you seek to live and go hard after God, the consequences of righteousness far outweigh the consequences of evil. The impact of evil is felt to three or four generations. The consequences of righteousness are felt to 1000 generations. Wow. That's four generations to a thousand generations. That's a 250 times better results. So let's live in that way. Investing in the future, making wise choices now, because we know generations that we will not know will be touched by what we decide today.

**Family Sphere 35: Parents and Children Reconciled.** 

Malachi 4:5-6. Look, I'm sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord arrives. His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse.

Now let's get the context. These are the last words of the last book, in the Original Testament. It's talking about family. Remember that the first words that God spoke to Abraham who started off this whole story, Genesis 12, was about family.

God said to Abraham He wanted to see every family blessed. It is about family and blessing. His last word are about if we don't have a heart for one another across generations, instead of blessing, there will be a curse. You can see this is the, this is the book and this is the meta narrative. This is the whole story of the Original Testament. God's heart is to bless every family. But if we don't walk in love our hearts toward one another fathers to their children, children to their parents, then, then we will not experience the blessing of God. It will result in curse.

Do you want to see your land blessed? Your nation blessed? Your society blessed? Your culture blessed? It begins with the family. This is what was said to Abraham. This is what, 1600 years later is said in Malachi. It's a millennia and a half later. When our hearts are not turned to one another, the land is cursed. Family love is a means of bringing blessing in the nation. Sometimes we think, ah, I want to change the world. So I'm going to go out and do this economic thing or this government thing or this media thing. All of those things are important, but Friends, changing the world begins at home, it begins in the family. And so let's never forget the importance of following God and his ways at home.

**Family Sphere 36: Adopted as God's Children.** 

Romans 8:14-15 For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received did not make you slaves so that you live in fear again. Rather that the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him, we cry, Abba Father.

The spirit of adoption is the spirit of, I love you, and I take voluntary responsibility to care for you. If I don't feed or clothe or educate my children, those that are born from the union of myself and my wife, you say, what an irresponsible human being he is. But if I don't do that for somebody else's children, no one thinks the worst of me. So imagine when I'd go and I adopt child, I have no social obligation to care for that child. And I say, I'm taking on the responsibility of a parent because I want to, because I desire you because you are important to me. You are precious. And I love you.

I know as kids sometimes, as children, we would tease someone very cruelly because they're not real parents they're are adopted, but actually the spirit of adoption is the most wonderful thing ever. It's the greatest thing. And when my wife and I understood this in our beginning of our marriage, we decided that the time of the birth of each of our children, as soon as the child was out and in our hands we prayed a blessing over each one of the four, the three boys and the daughter we have. And we said, the first thing we said, Dear Jonathan, dear Timothy, dear Sarah, dear Matthew. You from this day forward, are our son, our daughter, and we will care for you not because we have to, but because we want to. You are a physical child, but we adopt you in the Spirit. You are your, you are ours because we want you. Parents you can do this. God has done this for us. He fulfills his obligations for us, his responsibilities, not because he has to, but because he wants to. This is how we should live with our families. Not out of dire stress. Oh, I got to do this for my kids, but what a privilege we have to invest meaningfully, transformatively, lovingly in the life of another and make all the difference for their future.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

We're continuing with the biblical principles for living and family. This section we'll have eight passages and we begin with 

**Family Sphere 37: Every Family Member Valued.** 

2 Chronicles 31:15-16 says this: …They distributed the gifts among the families of priests in their towns by their divisions, dividing the gifts fairly among old and young alike. They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the Lord's temple to perform their daily duties according to their divisions.

This reflects a perspective that we find throughout the word of God. In Exodus, Moses said, "we will all go", when he's talking to Pharaoh and saying, you know, let my people go. He said some of you can go. He said, no, we will all go, young and old, our sons and daughters, our flocks our herds. We must all join in together in celebrating a festival to the Lord.

Pharaoh was not pleased with that. He replied on that occasion and you can read this an Exodus 10\. "Only the men may go and worship The Lord since that is what you requested". But that's not what he had requested. There were two different worldviews. Who needs to be there at the worship time? Who's important in the family? Just the men, the older males? Or everybody? And what is it in your culture? Does your culture line up with biblical culture? Are some valued more than others? Are the old more valued than the young? Is youth idolized? Are women second class? In God's kingdom all are valued in the family. God's kingdom advances when all are valued and included in his purposes,

God promises in Joel 2:28 that "I will pour out my spirit upon all people, your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams and your young men will see visions. I will pour out my spirit, even on servants, men and women alike, but everyone calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

Paul, excuse me, Peter, of course quotes this in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost. Again, let me just remind you the key words of that passage. All people, sons, daughters, old men, young men, servants, men, women, everyone. The message is pretty clear, isn't it? No one is excluded. Everyone is included. Everyone is valuable in the family, whatever age, whatever gender, whatever position in the family, each individual is treasured.

**Family Sphere 38: Caring for Family Members.** 

This comes from 1 Timothy 5:3-4,8. Take care of any widow who has no one else to care for her. But if she has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them. This is something that pleases God... But those who won't care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.

It says that the first responsibility is godliness at home. Wow that's a challenge. It's taking care of parents, taking care of relatives \- godliness and caring are linked together. Sometimes we think of godliness as being, you know, very straight-laced and sober and, and sanctimonious about doing just the right things. But really godliness is caring well. It's loving well, it's relating well and it's practical. It's real world stuff. You know, if you can make this work in your home, you can make it work any place. You can fool some of the people all of the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you're never going to fool your family. That's where they see who you really are. Home is where the rubber meets the road and it must make the kingdom of God work there in those relationships by our caring multi-generationally. If it works here, it'll work anywhere. So are you looking out for one another? Are you exhibiting the kingdom of God in the family? If you are, that's the beginning of a new reformation in your culture.

**Family Sphere 39: Widows and Orphans.** 

This comes with Exodus 22:22-23. You must not exploit a widow and orphan. If you exploit them in any way, and they cry out to me, then I will certainly hear their cry, says the Lord.

Widows and orphans. These are literally those who are widows and orphans. And also they're a metaphor for all those who do not have family members who are standing up for them, protecting them, caring for them, providing for them. It's talking about the disadvantaged, the marginalized, the vulnerable, the lonely in our society. What is God's plan? We're to reach out, we are to be thoughtful, we are to include. In the kingdom of God, we don't take advantage of people. Because they are so vulnerable, you could maybe hire them for less than the going rate because they're desperate. We don't do in the kingdom of God. We serve one another and we care for the least among us. We treat everyone with equal dignity.

**Family Sphere 40: A Kinsmen Redeemer.** 

This whole passage goes in Ruth 3:7-4:13. That's a long passage. I'm just going to read a few highlights.

The story, as you may recall, is a widow who's a foreigner who comes back to Israel because that's where her husband was from. And in a destitute situation. And she's working in the fields of a man named Boaz and he happens to be a relative. In the culture of that day, if a woman was widowed, the nearest relative was responsible for taking her into the home, even marrying her and having children so that the inheritance would pass on to the next generation. So when Ruth comes to Boaz and says she's interested in going through with this. He says, this, …I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman. But while it's true that I'm one of your family redeemers, there's another man who is more closely related to you than I am. Stay here tonight. And in the morning, I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he's not willing, then as surely as the Lord lives, I will redeem you myself\!…

And Boaz, the next day is he meets the other relative that says to the family redeemer, …”You know Naomi, who came back from Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here, in the presence of these witnesses… Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry, Ruth, the Moabite widow.

"Then I can't redeem it," the family redeemer replied. You redeem the land. I cannot do it." …

So Boaz took Ruth into his home. She became his wife. When he slept with her, the Lord enabled her to become pregnant and she gave birth to a son.

And of course, this is a really important family event in the Bible because her descendants lead to king David and ultimately to Jesus. So this is part of the great story of the Bible that impacts all of our families. 

Now this principle, this passage 40, embodies what we talked about in the previous one, 39, to not take advantage of someone else's misfortune. See he could, in his position as landowner, he could have just exploited Ruth's services to enrich himself or advantage himself in some way, but he doesn't do so. The **leverite \[?\]** laws, those are the laws that had men marry their brothers widows, were there to guard the economic wellbeing of the widows and the future inheritance of those to be born.

So Boaz deals with Ruth in a way that shows responsibility, self-sacrifice, and love. That should characterize all of our family relationships. We should always be reaching out in caring and love.

**Family Sphere 41: David Cares For Mephibosheth.**

And it takes us to key passage 41: David Cares for Mephibosheth. That's a good name to practice. Mephibosheth. 2 Samuel 9:1: One day David asked, "Is anyone in Saul's family still alive \- anyone to whom i can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"

Now, when he started out that question, "Is anyone in the Saul's family still alive?" I imagine everyone thought, oh, Saul's family. That's the prior king and his descendants they're the enemy. They're the ones whose dynasty could rise up in opposition, be a threat to David and his political future. Certainly he was wanting to find out who they are so he can kill them and rid himself of that security problem.

But he goes on to say, is there anyone in families, in Saul's family still alive? Anyone to whom I can show kindness. When we understand family we understand loyalty and biblical love, and how we do relationships. It changes everything. David's unconditional love was counter-cultural and counterintuitive. Mephibosheth would have been considered the crown prince, the next in line to step into his grandfather Saul's or his father Jonathon's place as king. Both had died in battle sometime earlier. He would've been viewed as David's political rival, a threat to his kingdom as he was the point person of the deposed dynasty of Saul. But David had covenanted with Jonathan. And that covenant was like, I going to treat you like family. This is biblical love.

This was an amazing story. When Jonathan did this with David, Jonathan knew, recognized that God was anointing David. Jonathan was the crown prince. And when he made this relationship with David, he is saying, I'm willing to relinquish my place so that you can be the next king. And when David made this covenant with Jonathan, he was saying, I will consider all of your descendants like my own family. This is a remarkable example of how our love should extend beyond just our nuclear family, into the relationships that God brings into our lives in a transforming way.

**Family Sphere 42: Families Serve the Community Together.** 

This is from Nehemiah 3:23,28. "After them, Benjamin and Hasshub repaired the section across from their house, and Azariah son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah repaired the section across from his house.... Above the Horse Gate, the priests repaired the wall, each one repaired the section immediately across from his own home.

You know the story perhaps. In Nehemiah. Jerusalem's walls have been destroyed. Nehemiah returns to repair the walls and he gets people involved. He motivates them to join with him. And there are teams of people all around the city involved in repairing the walls. And what he does is he asks people whose homes are near the wall to repair the wall by their homes. It's easy to motivate them because that's what you do. You do things to protect your family.

So this city-wide project of rebuilding the wall, focused on each family doing their own part. The part was, which was right across from their house. When each family did their normal part, the whole society benefited. The whole society was blessed. The whole society was safer and could thrive. Parents, sons, and grandsons are all involved, all mentioned here. It's a multi-generational community service.

Think about this. How does this apply in your life? Are there things that you can do with your family that served beyond your family? Can you do service projects together? What does your neighborhood community or city need? How can you involve your whole family? What impact can you make in your community as a family? If we get God's answers to those questions, we can start seeing transformation right where we live.

**Family Sphere 43: Friends and Family.** 

Proverbs 27:10. Never abandoned a friend, either yours or your father's. When disaster strikes, you won't have to ask your brothers for assistance. It's better to go to a neighbor than to a brother who lives far away.

This passage is about relational loyalty. One generation should build upon another. Do you know your father's friends? Do your children know your friends? Family and friends should have multi-generational continuity. We should pass on those relationships and honor those relationships that have been passed on to us. It's all about investing in relationships where you are, not despising the brother far away, but you are to take lessons about family love and apply them contextually to the relationships around you. Treat your neighbors like family. Family is not the exclusive place of love. It is the training ground that teaches you how to love all those around you well. Family love spills over into societal love. It touches your friends. It touches your neighbors. This is God's plan.

*Section Introduction*

The next section that we're going to be looking at is Family and Healthcare. Healthcare is something very interesting. Healthcare is not the domain or concern of just one sphere. Because the health of every individual is important to all of society. Multiple spheres participate in healthcare. Family is where it begins, but then it's supported by religion and government and economics, the businesses that develop the medicines and provide the services. All of those things come to play. So in each one of our spheres we're going to be having a section on, on that sphere and healthcare, these first four ones. And so we'll start with family. There are three passages that we're gonna look at here.

**Family Sphere 44: Children Should Care for Elderly Parents.** 

This comes from Mark 7:9-13. Then he said (this is Jesus speaking to the religious leaders of his day) You skillfully sidestep God's law in order to hold onto your own tradition. For instance, Moses gave you this law from God: Honor, your father and mother, and Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father and mother must be put to death.' But you say it is alright for people to say to the parents, 'Sorry, I can't help you, for I vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.' In this way, you let them disregard their needy parents. And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition…

What is more important, your tradition, your culture, your personal convictions, or aligning yourself with the word of God? See, to honor your parents, the fifth commandment of the 10 commandments, did not merely mean to respect them or pay attention to them. It meant to care for them and to provide for them, especially as they advanced in years and were no longer able to care for themselves. If your aged parents were financially destitute and could not provide for themselves and had to live in the streets or in some inappropriate housing situation, it was a responsibility to the children to provide for them. To not do so would be shameful; it is the opposite of honoring to have, it would be dishonoring the parents to allow them who had provided for you in the early years of your life to now be destitute because you're not providing for them.

So what was going on? The religious leaders in Jesus' day were teaching that if you give to a religious cause like to supporting the Levites or the priests or the furnishings of the Temple or anything like that, well, then you were exempt from this obligation. You didn't have to provide your aging parents. They pushed the idea that the church or the temple or the religious institution that they were involved with trumped the family, was more important and made it sound really spiritually. If you do this, you know, giving to support us, oh, I mean giving to God, then you don't have to do this other stuff. That is really not spiritual. It is disobedient. Jesus exposes this for what it is. Disregard for God and disobedience to his word. Taking care of needy parents in the season of life where they have increasing healthcare issues is really important. Our cultures do this in different ways. Consider the word of God. What do you have to change in order to honor your father and mother?

**Family Sphere 45: Parents Care for their Children's Health.** 

Luke 8:41-42. So this is where life begins for us. And will you read this story: Then a man named Jaruis, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come home with him. His only daughter, who was about 12 years old was dying…

As we said earlier, healthcare is an area of shared responsibility. It always begins with family. At later times in life, religion and government and economics all participate. And that's biblical. There was a good basis for that, but it begins with family. The life, health, and wellbeing of every individual is a shared responsibility. Parents are the first ones who carry this. Since they're the life givers, they're the life protectors. They're the ones who watch over the health of their children. And so we must always make sure that parents' rights in the care of their children is always protected. This is not just something you have to do. Notice this passage. It says that Jairus was pleading with Jesus. He was desperate. He loved his daughter. This is a point of passion, of deep emotion. And we need to honor families in this role.

**Family Sphere 46: Sickness and Family Matters.** 

John 9:1-3. As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. "Rabbi," His disciples asked him, "why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents' sins?" "It was not because of his sins, or his parents' sins," Jesus answered. "This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.

Sometimes when we encounter someone who is sick or has some kind of disease or infirmity or physical dysfunction, we ask, why is this person sick?

I'm going to tell you a story. I have dear, dear friends in South Africa who, he, he got very sick. He had a digestive tract problem, and he was rushed to the hospital and they saved him miraculously, but he had to have a good part of his small intestines cut out to do that. And so it was a long time of recovery. 

My wife, Christine, our kids lived very close to this dear family. So we spent the nights in the hospital with him, help babysit their kids so that his wife could be with him. We just surrounded them and supported them as much as we could for several weeks as they were in the recovery mode. During this time, several times, she would get phone calls and people would come and visit her and try to give her some wisdom from God as to why he got so sick. There was a sin in this, or if it was something over there or some curse or some spiritual warfare. And one day I was at the house and someone had just called her and said, no, that she needed to repent, this, that, or the other so that her husband could be well, and she put down the phone and came and was just crying.

And she came to me and said, "David, I want to thank you. So many have tried to give us their wisdom. And you've been such a good friend. You have no wisdom to give us at all." And we've laughed about that over the years, the way that came out. But you know, when someone is sick, we don't always understand the why. And it's usually not helpful to try to pin it on one thing or another. It's an opportunity for God to show up and we just need to be present. That's what you do in family. You're there with people. You hang out with them. You love them. When they're sick, you, you step in and, and you sweep the floors and you do the dishes and you cook the meals that they normally would have done because they are not able to do that. This is what we do. This is what the kingdom looks like. We don't have to have all the answers. We do need to be present and love.

Job's friends were friends the first few days when they came and just sat with him. The moment they started talking it went downhill. They tried to explain to him why he was having these problems. And just like in my story of my friends in South Africa, and their wisdom did not help at all. And God says, don't listen to their words. What we need is an encounter with God in the midst of moments of pain. And what we do as the broader community is come alongside in that way.

Now some health issues are family related. You know, you might have a heart disease that you have a propensity for because your father and your grandfather had it. Or you might have grown up in an alcoholic environment with an alcoholic parent and that produces certain issues in your own life, but not everything is related to family. Some diseases have spiritual origins and some are just physical. We can't always know. There's usually a blend, but no matter what, God wants to display his power and we should display his love.

**Crossovers Introduction**

Now, at the end of each of our sections of each sphere, we're going to look at some crossover passages, how this sphere relates to another sphere. And some of the passages you will look at will show positive examples of collaboration between two spheres. And some of the examples will show you negative events in which one sphere tries to dominate or control the other sphere in a way that was not beneficial, did not add to thriving and **shalom.** So we'll take a look at some of those right now.

**Family Sphere 47: Family and Economics.** 

I'm going to read to you some selections from Acts 5:1-10. This is the time of the early church. And there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property. He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife's consent, he kept the rest. Then Peter said, "Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself. The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, that the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren't lying to us but to God\!" As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified. Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.

About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, "Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?" "Yes," she replied, "that was the price." And Peter said, "How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out too."

Instantly she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

Wow, this is a sober story. Economics and family. Now, to understand this story, you have to understand that just before there is another story of a man named Barnabas who sold his property and gave all of it. No one was requiring to give it all, but he decided to that. And everyone was so encouraged. Ananias and Sapphire said, wow, we'd like to have maybe that same kind of respect and the acclaim that Barnabas had. So let's sell our property, but we'll keep some of it, but we'll say we gave it all. The problem wasn't the economics. The problem was the lying about it. It was the deception.

So here we have family, economics and religion. They were trying to get religious kudos, you know, like very committed, wonderful people. But God's Spirit knew that deception when there's economic deception in the family, bad things happen. And so the tragedy is that they had conspired, they had agreed together to lie. It was a joint decision to deceive. So to gain this recognition, status, appreciation. So that's a warning to us. As a family let’s make sure that all of our financial dealings are done with integrity and honesty and transparency.

**Family Sphere 48: Family and Government.** 

This comes from 2 Chronicles 25:4. Its speaking in this passage of king Amaziah. However, he \[Amaziah\] did not kill the children of the assassins, (of his father) for he obeyed the command of the Lord as written by Moses in the book of the Law: "Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of their parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes."

So what's the background of this story? Well, Amaziah was the ninth monarch, eighth king, but there was a queen in that line. So the ninth monarch of the Southern kingdom of Judah. His father, Joash of Judah, had begun well, but as later in life had abandoned the Lord. You can see this in 2 Chronicles 24\. And he led to a humiliating defeat and ultimately the assassination at the hands of Jozacar and Jehozabad.

Amaziah was crowned as a result to be king at 25 and sought to apply God's laws in the governmental role. Now the cultural custom of course, was to find the assassins, kill them and kill all of the family members. Again, just making sure that as you were taking vengeance on them, there were no survivors who could retaliate and resulted in ever escalating cycle of violence and retribution. But Amaziah didn't do what was the cultural standard, what was the cultural norm. He heeded the words of Deuteronomy 24:16, that parents should not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of the parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes. No one else's. So the children were not guilty. So he did something transformative. As king he could have issued the command, he had the power to do so, but he did not exercise that because he knew that even though it was normative, it was not in keeping with God's ways and character.

And so he exercised godly self-control and did not use the governmental powers he had to harm the family members of the guilty assassins. This an example of cultural transformation.

**Family Sphere 49: Family and Religion.** 

We read this in Luke 11:27-28. As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, "God, bless your mother-- the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you\!" Jesus replied, "But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."

What is going on? This sounds like a very strange interchange in our 21st century ears. Well, the woman's words reflected the traditional rabbinic position that women receive God's blessing indirectly through they're seeing their menfolk \- their sons, their husbands do the work of God because a woman could not serve God in her own right.

So the rabbis have taught, and I quote. This comes from actually from the **mishnah:\[?\]** **"Where might the women earn merit? By making their children go to synagogue to learn the scripture and their husbands to go to the Mishnah and waiting for their husbands until they return."**

In this worldview, Mary would have been in blessed above all women, because no woman had ever had a son like Jesus. And, but Jesus said, this is not God's view. You're not just, you're not just blessed because you have godly men folk, you're blessed because of who you are. 

And so Jesus' response wasn't being dismissive of his mother. On the contrary throughout his life He lovingly and respectfully addresses her as Dear woman, we see that in John 2:4 and 19:26. And he's concerned for her wellbeing. In fact, one of the last things he says on the cross, as he points are to John and make sure that she's well taken care of. So there's not a problem with his mother.

But Jesus' response is addressing the fact that women are relegated to only being valuable in their role as mothers. That's a valuable role. But when that's the only thing that you have or can do, that is a limitation that God never intended. His words are categorical rejection of a system of thought, which excludes active participation in the things of God based upon gender. Jesus will have no part in religious values that relegate, exempt, exclude, and limit a person's walk within ministry for God. In his kingdom, blessedness is not getting through a family member's merit or ministry. Personal obedience to the word of God is the foundation of blessedness. 

He doesn't ask is that male obedience or female obedience? He said, if you hear God's word and you do it, you are blessed. 

Culturally determined gender roles are not the basis of Jesus' valuing of people. Hearing and obeying the word of God is His universal standard. It's an equal playing field for all. All who are obey his word, there's no God-given limit on their God-given destiny.

**Family Sphere 50: Family and Education.** 

These are, this comes from Psalm 78:1-8. This is so rich. …I will teach you hidden lessons from our past \-- stories we have heard and known, stories our ancestors handed down to us. We will not hide these truths from our children; we will tell the next generation about the glorious deeds of the Lord, by his power and his mighty wonders. For he issued his laws to Jacob; He gave his instructions to Israel. He commanded our ancestors to teach them to their children, so the next generation might know them \--even the children not yet born \--and they in turn will teach their own children. So each generation should set hope anew on God, not forgetting his glorious miracles and obeying his commands. Then they will not be like their ancestors-- stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful, refusing to give their hearts to God.

Each generation is responsible for the next one: for the education, the training, the passing on of the stories of God, the truth of God. The family is to be the primary steward of the next generation's education.

He commanded the parents to teach God's law to their children. Let me quote, two other passages here in Deuteronomy 4:10-13. Moses says this, Never forget the day when you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Sinai, where you told me summon the people before me and I will personally instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live and they will teach their children to fear me also. That's the key thing. 

Also in Deuteronomy 11:18 and following, Moses says this: So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words of mine, tie them to your hand, wear are they on your forehead as reminders, teach them to your children. Talk about them, when you're at home and when you're on the road, when you're going to bed. And when you're getting up. Write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates so as long as the sky remains above the earth, you and your children may flourish in the land God swore to give your ancestors.

Do you see that? At home, on the road, on the architecture, on your clothing, on your physical adornments, in the morning, at night, this is supposed to be family and education are always supposed to be interacting and investing in that next generation.

**Family Sphere 51: Family and the sphere of Media/Communication.** 

Going to read from 1 Timothy 5:1-2. "Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him respectfully as you would your to own father. Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters."

Wow. How do we treat people? We should treat them, we should speak to them the same way that we were taught to treat the closest members of our family. With love, respect, with kindness. There's no license for harshness, disrespect, or impurity. This is really important for us. 

You know, there are certain things that you, you don't say to your mom, you would just be totally inappropriate, but do you say those things on social media? Sometimes we communicate in ways that, because we don't see the person and we don't have that relational stuff, we feel like there's a license to be harsh, a license to be judgmental, a license to do things that we wouldn't say face to face in our family environment. If it's wrong to say it in your family, it's wrong to say it online. 

Family is to be a training ground as to how we should communicate and the standard that we have there should be the standard for our communication. Now, if your family's standard was not great, then that needs to be redeemed too. But how should you have talked to your mom? How should you have talked to your dad? Or your brothers or your sisters? That's what we want to recover.

**Family Sphere 52: Family and Celebration**

Our last passage in this sphere. This is the sphere of Family and Celebration. Exodus 12:1-4. While the Israelites were still in the land of Egypt, the Lord gave the following instructions to Moses and Aaron, ...Announce to the whole community of Israel that on the 10th day of this month each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for sacrifice, one animal for each household. If a family is too small to eat a whole animal, let them share with another family in the neighborhood. Divide the animal according to the size of each family and how much they can eat.

You know, this is the greatest cultural celebration among the Jewish people. It has been practiced nearly three and a half thousand years. Three-and-a-half millennia. It's a family centric celebration, which has far reaching societal impact. As it tells and retells in visual and culinary arts, the story of God's redemption. Family is the place where the creativity of this celebration, where the is story is rehearsed and passed on to the next generation. Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sack,(spell) does one of the most famous Ted talks that has ever been posted. And he talks about the Passover feast in this way. He says Jews have been scattered and dispersed and exiled for 2000 years. We never lost our identity. Why? Because at least once a year on the festival of Passover, we told our story and we taught it to our children and we ate the unleavened bread of affliction and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery. So we never lost our identity. I think collectively, you've got to get back to telling our story, who we are, where we came from, what ideals by which we live. And if that happens, we'll become strong enough to welcome the stranger and say, come and share our lives, share our stories, share our aspirations and dreams.

Celebration is a powerful way to disciple a nation. Celebration begins in the family, cultivating traditions that go from generation to generation, century to century. Millenia to Millenia, to bring God's ways, God's story, into the life of the culture.



**Economic Sphere Introduction**

We're ready to look at the sphere of economics. Economics involves both science and technology and also business. God's purpose for this sphere is to release provision and model stewardship. Science is the motor of this sphere. It produces the research and makes possible the creation of wealth by inventing new products and services. The sphere moves forward by the distributive capacity of the business enterprise, which produces and sells those inventions. When stewarded well, this process of creating and distributing wealth should enhance the life of people and glorify the Creator who inspires innovation. 

We will begin in this sphere like in all the spheres, looking at God's role. So God in this sphere of economics. We're going to look at six different passages and see that God is very concerned and very involved in this area. We should be too. 

**Economic Sphere 1: God Created Everything.**   
We read in Isaiah 42:5-7 the following: God, the Lord created the heavens and stretched them out. He created the earth and everything in it. He gives breath to everyone, life to everyone who walks the earth. And it is he who says, "I, the Lord have called you to demonstrate my righteousness. I will take you by hand and guard you, and I will give you to my people, Israel, as a symbol of my covenant with them. And you will be a light to guide the nations. You will open the eyes of the blind. You'll free the captives from prison, releasing those who sit in dark dungeons. 

The first thing we need to note is that God is the Creator. This is how he first introduces himself in Genesis. And this is how he in this messianic passage that is often spoken as one of the servant songs of Isaiah, how the Father is speaking to Jesus the coming Messiah. And he emphasizes his role as Creator. 

If we go back to Genesis and begin looking through the Original Testament, we see that there are four different words that God uses over and over again in the scriptures to talk about his creativity. One is the word **bara**'. God is the one who does this. Very rarely is this word used for human beings. About 89% of the times it's found in the scriptures it's God doing the action. It means to bring something out of nothing. This is remarkable creativity. 

Also, the word ‘stretched out’ **Nawtaw,** and God does this he's he takes something and he amplifies it increases. It does something new with it. There's also the word **Raca**', which is likewise translated ‘created’ and very interestingly, the word **nathan**, which is about being generous, about giving. And what God gives is life. He is the life giver. That is the main thing that he is noted for in all the things that happens. 

Economics therefore, should be about giving life too. It should be about enhancing life. It begins with generosity. As God gave of himself, we are to give ourselves to others. Life is within God and he shares it with us. Breathing life into Adam from within himself and we in the economics sphere should take what God has placed within us and generously share it to the benefit of all.

**Economic Sphere 2: God Continues to Do New Things.**   
Isaiah 43:19: For I am about to do something new. See, I have already begun\! Do you not see it? I will make a pathway through the wilderness. I will create rivers in the dry wasteland. 

Economics doesn't happen without innovation. Innovation brings forth life, and God is the innovator par excellence. This passage talks about newness, and we might get that from our own understanding. But when the Jews heard this, the Israelites for this passage, it was especially significant because of the greatest story in their history was the story of the Exodus. This story occupies four books of the Old Testament. And is referred to hundreds of times in the remaining part of the Original Testament, as well as the New Testament. It is the story of God's redemption. 

And it changed the economic, the reality of the people of God forever. They had been slaves, oppressed economically, and they became a free people with great opportunities economically. But in that story, what God did was he led them through the Red Sea. He turned a watery place into a dry place. He made a path through the ocean to liberate them from Egypt and bring them into the promised land. 

But now centuries later through Isaiah he says, God is going to do something new. And when you think \- something new, of course\! He's gonna do a miracle again, like he did in the past. And the greatest miracle is taking a watery place \- an ocean \- and making it a highway through it. 

But God does something different. Here He says, I'm going to make a pathway in the wilderness. I'm going to create rivers in the dry land. Instead of making a wet place dry, he's gonna make a dry place wet. You see, it's really hard to box God in. He's always doing something new. When you think you've got him figured out, he's got another surprise for you. He's so innovative. And if we will learn from him, we can co-create with him and see fabulous things happen in the economics sphere. 

**Economic Sphere 3: God Provides for All Creation.**   
Psalm 147:8-9 says this. He covers the heavens with clouds, provides rain for the earth and makes the grass grow in mountain pastures. He gives food to the wild animals and feeds the young ravens when they cry. 

God gives us the stuff that is necessary for life. He provides us with things that enable us to grow and mature and develop and increase. We read here that he gives food to the animals. This, this thought that God gives food is found in at least 13 other Old Testament passages. God is generous and his economics is rooted in generosity. He cares for others. He provides for them. 

I know my story of my father-in-law who formed a business and grew it and had dozens of families working for him. His attitude was always this: I have to do well because what I am doing is I'm providing finances and security for all these families. If I make a mistake, their children will suffer. They need this to prosper so they can prosper. And their children and their households can do well. He was always thinking about how he could do his work to help provide food for those who worked with him. This is very much reflects the heart of God who loves to give food to all of his creation. 

**Economic Sphere 4: God Provided in the Desert.**   
Deuteronomy 29:5- 6, says the following: For 40 years I led you through the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out. You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink, but he provided for you food so you would know that he is the Lord your God. 

God's provision is purposeful. He provides for us. He cares for us. He meets our physical and economic needs so that you would know your God. It is to call us into place of intimacy, into place of relationship. Life and relational intimacy are God's purposes for generosity. 

God's care for people is matchless. He gives food in the desert, a place that is known for not having food. He provides in the most unexpected places. God is caring. He's capable, he's compassionate, he's competent, he's committed. And he's creative. This is our God. This is how he engages with us in ways that shape our economies and this is foundational to the way that scriptures see this very important sphere that touches all of our lives. These are the qualities that we should seek to emulate. As we seek to be his people in this sphere of economics. 

**Economic Sphere 5: God's Extravagant Generosity.**   
We read from Romans 8:31-32. What then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also along with him, graciously, give us all things. 

God's love is without compare. He's a self-sacrificing, need- meeting, grace \-extending, over the top generous God. He meets our needs and then more and more and more. He didn't withhold the greatest treasure, his own life, the life of his Son, that which was most precious to him. Certainly he will give us all that is needed. 

His attitude counters the greed that fuels and drives much of our world's economic system. But it's his generosity that fuels the true economics of the world. We need to learn how to be motivated by this dynamic of generosity, rather than by the need for greed. 

The kingdom operates on giving and receiving. It's not about what I can get or how I can maximize my return on investment. What, what does look like an economic system of buying and selling in our world? How do we, how do we model giving and receiving in the midst of that system? True entrepreneurship is rooted in discovering how we can generally meet other people's needs. That's when business flourishes. We see people's need, and create products and services and tools that genuinely serve them. And we're giving of ourselves our energy, our time, our talents, our resources, to provide those things in order to enhance their lives. Those things cause people to flourish and will cause your business to flourish as well.

**Economic Sphere 6: God is our Healer.**   
Exodus 15:23-26 says this: When they came to the oasis of Marah, the water was too bitter to drink… So Moses cried out to the Lord for help. And the Lord showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water and this made the water good to drink. It was there at Marah that the Lord set before them the following decree as a standard to test a faithfulness to him. He said, if you will listen carefully to the voice of the Lord, your God and do what is right in his sight, obey his commands and keeping all his decrees, then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I set on the Egyptians. For I am the Lord who heals you." 

As you go through these spheres, you'll quickly discover that healthcare is an area that is in which multiple spheres are engaged. Why? Because everyone is concerned about the life and wellbeing of individuals. 

It begins with family. Family, parents care for the newborn child and nurture, protect their young ones. And when they get too old to take care of themselves, the children take care of them. But it's not just family that is concerned about healthcare. It's also religion. The Levites of old were charged with health issues to take care of people, to help observe and oversee the care. And Jesus doing his ministry and earth frequently healed. 

Not just family and religion, but also business. The scientific technologies and discoveries of medicines and vaccinations and different antibiotics and things that can enhance healthcare, how to do operations and all of the technology that has been developed over the generations to be able to make sure that health is maintained and we are able to thrive. And life is extended. It's important to all of us. Even government whose goal is to protect and serve and save the people, to keep them safe. Healthcare is important. 

Healthcare is a shared concern. But this area of economics involving science and business is really central because it is always discovering new ways to assist in this process. God gives life and God preserves life as our Healer. And he's the one who reveals the technologies that we are discovering, as was in the case of Moses at Marah. 

Now this might be interesting to you as they drank this water and was producing illness. We don't know the exact specifics of it. God says, there's this branch and cut it off and throw it into the water and whatever it was, it was either a change of the pH in the water or some catalytic impact because of the chemistry combinations \- that water, which previously had been undrinkable and unsafe for that health was now made good to drink. It was made potable. And the key thing is that he was learning from God, God gave Moses a key and he acted accordingly. 

We may not know all the details of exactly what the science or the technology or why it worked as it did, but partnership with God in discovery for solutions to find health and preserve life \- This is one of the things that we need to be involved with in the area of economics, to engage with God's world in a way that benefits the community. God's instructors to Moses enabled him to act in such a way that the environment was changed and health was restored. And this is something we should all seek for in this sphere.

**Section introduction**  
This next section is about innovative science and technology. We'll look at seven different passages that highlight the place of science and technology in the scriptures and how it fuels the economic machine, how it undergirds business and allows financial wellbeing to be established for all people. 

**Economic Sphere 7: Given a Scientific Research Task.**   
Wow. Who was given that task? Well, we read about it in Genesis 2:19- 20. And at that time there was only one person alive whose name was Adam. So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one. He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds of the sky and all the wild animals. But there was no helper just right for him. 

Now we're gonna look at this passage again when we get to passage 14, because there are two distinct jobs that God gives Adam in the garden. One is a production job. That's the one we're gonna look at later where he becomes a gardener and helps produce food and cultivate plants. But the other one is a research job and that's what we're looking at right now. It has to do with science and technology. 

The exact title of the job was chief animal namer. And there are two main ideas in this. First of all, this command that God gave involved a wonderful offer of partnership. Up to this point in everything that God created, days one through five, God created something then he looked at it and analyzed what he had done. He evaluated and he named it. He gave nomenclature, understanding. He called this darkness, he called ‘night’. And light he called ‘day’. And every day he creates, he analyzes, he evaluates and he names. 

And today God invites human beings to join him. After all, he's made us in his likeness and image so that we can participate with him. He at an infinite level, we at a finite level in the things that he's doing on earth. And so this is a wonderful invitation to intimacy. So we must, as we think about this area of science and research and the role it plays in economics, we must understand that the call is primarily the first instance, one of intimacy. To be in fellowship with the Creator who wants to reveal his ways to us so that we can work with him. 

But the other thing, the second thing that is involved in this is that he charges Adam to create a taxonomy. That's a big word to mean a structure of ordering things, to research and understand and organize the world around us. We need to make sense of the world in which we live and be able to describe it in meaningful ways. And God named things after analyzing classifying them. He created taxonomies in the first five days, and that is a, that was important, but scientists are still working on creating a comprehensive taxonomy of living creatures. Do you realize that not every species has been identified and named? We understand that it's a very complex process. 

Now for the Hebrews, in Genesis one, they had a very simple taxonomy. It was based on, on where the creatures lived. If they were in the sky or lived on the land or lived in the water. So there were three kinds of creatures and you can see two of them were made in day five and then others are day six. But we look at animals in different ways. 

First of all, we divide the created order into flora and a fauna. And the animal kingdom is comprised of 10 phylum as it's called. And, uh, and the, the, one of the phylum is the chordata. That means the vertebrae animals. Okay? And there are five basic classes among vertebrae animals. And one of those classes is called the mammals. Okay? And there are 21 orders of mammals. And within those 21 orders, one of them is called the carnivores or the meat-eaters. And, this is a family within the order, within the class. And among the meat-eaters, all the, the **felidae,** or all the cats, big cats and small cats and lions and tigers and cheetahs and Puma, and, and even your little house cat \- and there are 14 different genres of cats. And one of the genres is the **panthera** genus. It's the great cats. And there are five species of that. There's the Jaguar, the leopard, the lion, the snow leopard, and the tiger. 

Why am I telling you all of this? Well, in order to understand who a lion is, you've gotta have like his first name and his second and third and fourth name all the way to his last name. A lion is an animal, who's a vertebrate, who's a mammal, who's a meat-eater, who's a cat, who's a great cat, and specifically a lion. 

And when, when Adam was naming animals, he wasn't just going Mr. Kangaroo, Mrs. Kangaroo, Mr. Hippopotamus, Mrs. Hippopotamus. He was organizing life. He was saying, these things are like one another. They fit together. They belong together. And these other things are different. They have a different name, they belong together. And, and that was just incredible process of discovery. Using our God \-given gifts, our mind, to understand the reality of the world around us and as followers of Jesus, we need to be people who research and understand very concrete and very realistically the world around us. That's the value of this scientific task. 

**Economic Sphere 8: Twelve Spies Research Agricultural Potential.**   
This is Economic Spheres 13:17-20. Moses gave them the instructions as he sent them out to explore the land: ... See what the land is like, is it good or bad? Is the soil fertile or poor? Are there many trees? Do your best to bring back samples of the crop you see. 

Sometimes we think of the spies and we think about, that they're doing military research, they're trying to size up \- Are we gonna be able to conquer the land? And certainly there was a military engagement and concern that they were looking at. But one of the key aspects of their assignment was the exploration and discovery to understand what was the Iand like? God had promised the land flowing with milk and honey, that sounded like a really good land. Did this land that they were considering entering into, did it match their expectations? 

You see, research is rooted in experimental physical reality. You have a hypothesis and you go and test it. Is this gonna be a good land? Let's check it out. Here\! Check out the land. Is it good or bad? Is the soil fertile or poor? I want to see some samples. That requires analysis and evaluation leading to the possibility of good choices. Good choices that result in beneficial consequences for humanity. That's what this is all about. And God is teaching us through his word that this is how we should approach life. If we listen to him and obey him, go where he asks us to go, we'll discover that his promises are true. That what he said is good, is good. And if we obey him, it'll be beneficial for all of us. 

**Economic Sphere 9: Nehemiah Researches Architectural Needs.**   
Nehemiah 2:12-18. I'm gonna read you some portions of this passage. Nehemiah has heard about the destruction of Jerusalem. He's living in exile, and he wants to, feels called of God to go and help restore Jerusalem once again. So he is just arrived back in the city. And he says this: I slipped out during the night taking only a few others with me... After dark I went out through the Valley gate, past the Jackel's Well, and over to the Dung gate to inspect the broken walls and burned gates. Then I went to the Fountain gate into the King’s pool. I went up to Kidron valley instead inspecting the walls before I turned back and entered again at the Valley Gate. …The city officials did not know I'd been out there or what I was doing... But now I said to them, ...Let us rebuild the wall in Jerusalem and end this disgrace\!" ...They replied at once, "Yes, let's rebuild the wall\!" So they began the good work. 

When he heard the news of Jerusalem's destruction that the walls had broken down, and enemies could come in and out of the city at will, his heart was broken. And back in the place of Exile, he began in prayer. He began an intercession and confession, and cried out to God. He got permission from the king to return to his native land. And the first thing he did was to check out \- was the report that had been given him. Was it true? Again, he had heard of the problem, but confirmed reality through intentional personal research. He was teachable. He wasn't dogmatic. He wasn't saying, well, this is the way it is, I know. He went to check it out. Was it really so? He was open to discovery. He adopted the attitude of a learner and what he discovered gave him a framework to propose a solution that would address the needs of the community. So after he'd gathered that data and talked to the leaders, they said, yes, let's rebuild. And they began a good work. 

If we will do research and science and technology, that's birthed in prayer, following God's ways, it will result in good work. 

**Economic Sphere 10: Jacob's Sheep Breeding.**   
I'm gonna read some selections from Genesis 30:27-43. ...What wages do you want? Laban \[Jacob's father-in-law\] asked again. Jacob replied, "Don't give me anything. Just do this one thing... remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled and spotted along with all, all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages… All right, Laban replied… Then Jacob took some fresh branches and he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flock came to drink, for that was where they mated… And they gave birth to young who were streaked, speckled and spotted... This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban's. As a result, Jacob became very wealthy with large flocks and sheep and goats, female, and male servants and many camels and donkeys. 

This is a very interesting story. Laban and Jacob were both tricksters. They were all both trying to beat each other out. It was a very unhappy kind of family relationship. What was going on? Laban had changed Jacob's salary 10 times. And so had to cheat him at time and time again. And so he said, okay, I don't want a salary, just let me keep the sheep that aren't white. You know, the wool that was all white was the ideal for making cloth, because you could die it and it would be evenly colored, because there was not any mutation of color. But he said, I don't think the black ones and the speckle ones and the striped ones and all the ones that are still valuable sheep, but they're not quite as valuable for the world production as you're like, I'll take the lesser. That's sounded like a great deal to Laban. And besides most of the sheep were all white. 

But he developed a very interesting peculiar methodology. We don't even know exactly how it all worked, but the key is, is this that he discovered a way to breed sheep that were speckled. The majority were coming out, not white, but these variants of colors and the wool was not as suitable for the normal dying and production of clothing. See, he had studied their mating rituals and understood how to produce desired results in an innovative way. He was thoughtful. He was intentional. He was purposeful. His science was the basis of becoming very wealthy. 

After several generations and seasons of the flocks producing streaked and spotted and black sheep, they were the majority of the herd. Almost those white sheep were born. So the link between technological innovation and wealth creation is established. 

Today you know, we don't stick branches stripped of the bark in water when sheep are mating, that that's a strange combination of things that don't seem to make sense to go together. But we do other things. We take movies and to-do lists and calendars and phones and games, things that 20-30 years ago, would've been considered very diverse topics and we put them all together and we make an iPhone. And you do things that are new combinations, new ways \- sticks and water and mating sheep. Movies and internet and phones \-and you put them all together. And these seemingly disparate things combined in unique new ways, all of a sudden creates a new activity and new product and wealth is created. Opportunities for myriads of jobs and billions of dollars to be created because of this kind of innovation. So we see in the Bible in their days doing things that can be a model for us today in our economic spheres. 

**Economic Sphere 11: The Value of Safe Transportation Systems.**   
What? The Bible talks about safe transportation systems? You betcha. Judges 5:6,10. In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, people avoided the main roads, and travelers stayed on winding pathways... Consider this, you who ride on fine donkeys, you who sit on fancy saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road. 

See if you don't have good road systems- safe \- that are easy to travel on and are protected from marauders, then the whole economic system is impacted. The creation of safe transportation systems enhance economic development. And this is what the Bible's talking about. We have to create structures and mechanisms within our societies that enable us to get our products and services to the people who need them most. If roadways are not safe, all suffer. This would've involved good engineering and good governance together resulting in something that would benefit the whole of society. That's what economics, together with others spheres of society need to do as they collaborate together for the good of all. 

You know, we have to keep reminding ourselves that these spheres are not about dominating or controlling. They're about serving. They collaborate together. They work together because that's how everything that is good happens in the kingdom of God. When you lay down your pride, you lay down your own agenda, you serve and care for others. People who build roads today, they're thinking about how does this benefit people who they may never even meet, but it makes a difference. All of us are better when people serve one another well. 

**Economic Sphere 12: Hezekiah's Engineering Wonder.** 

This is from 2 Kings 20:20. The rest of the events of Hezekiah's reign \[king of Judah, the Southern kingdom\] including the extent of his power and how he built a pool and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city, are recorded in The book of the History of the Kings of Judah. 

What is this verse referring to? Well, when the Assyrians threatened Judah, they had already conquered the kingdom of the north and taken them into captivity and they had invaded Judah. They had surround Jerusalem, were approaching Jerusalem and wanted to choke, choke it and just get it to capitulate and surrender. Hezekiah knew that he needed to protect the city by making sure it had water when it was under siege. The main source of the water for Jerusalem was the Gabon Spring. And he closed that off so that the invading Assyrian troops would not be able to use it. And he dug a tunnel underground through rock that was 533 meters, 1,750 feet long, And siphoned all that water that was from outside the city wall, into the city. The enemies could not access the water and the residents of the city could. This was a phenomenal engineering feat. 

It was only in this past generation that the tunnel was rediscovered. And at the entrance, it describes those plaques that describe how it was done. There were actually two teams, one starting at the spring and one within the city that began digging and they dug underground and they met in the middle. This 3000 years ago was a phenomenal, was a phenomenal breakthrough. Almost 3000 years ago from the eight, because this was in year 701 BC**.** It took two years to build and it saved Jerusalem. Phenomenal engineering. 

Today, its only in the recent times that when, after it's been discovered, you can go and you can take a walk through Hezekiah's tunnel in the city of Jerusalem. You'll kind of have to duck in some places and you'll get your feet wet because the water will come to your ankles. And sometimes up to your chest level, there's still water there that flows through it. But it's, you, when you do that and you go to Jerusalem, you're walking through an engineering feat 2,800 plus years old. It's just really remarkable. When we use science for the good of the people. It has a lasting value. 

**Economic Sphere 13: Uzziah’s Inventive War Machines**  
Uzziah's, \[or Isaiah, goes by both names\], Inventive War Machines. 2 Chronicles 26:14-15. It says this: Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows and sling stones. And he built structures on the walls of Jerusalem, designed by experts to protect those who shot arrows and hurled large stones from the towers and corners of the wall. 

Structures designed by experts to protect. He designed walls and ways that had not been done before that gave an advantage to the defenders of the city and allowed them to be able to protect the city from invaders without putting their own life at risk. This engineering was key to Uzziah's success. As a governmental leader he knew how to bring these experts, these researchers, these technologists, these construction experts and involve themnas these spheres collaborated together, We read later on in 2 Chronicles, that king Uzziah became strong and is fame spread far. Science, technology, research leads to the protection of people when done in the godly way.

**Section Introduction**  
Uh, this next section is about biblical principles for business. We'll look at 15 passages that address a wide range of economic issues. Financial realities touch almost every aspect of our lives from basic subsistence among the poor to societal thriving when economic systems are healthy. God takes a keen interest in how we do businesses, not just what we do, but how we do it. These principles give us a framework for how we’re to steward the Earth's resources. How we are to provide for our families with diligence, integrity, and compassion. How we live this aspect of our life can result in either blessings or curses for us individually, for our families and for society at large. Let's learn together. 

**Economic Sphere 14: A God-Given Job.**   
Genesis 2:8-9,15. Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he placed the man he had made. The Lord God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground \- trees that were beautiful, and that produced delicious fruit... The Lord God placed the man in the garden of Eden to tend and watch over it. 

We already looked in passage number seven, that God gave Adam a scientific job, research job, naming the animals. This is this other job he gives him. It's about tending the garden. It was about being economically productive in nature, making sure that those trees that produce delicious fruit stayed healthy and the fruit was being produced for the inhabitants of the garden. He was invited again to participate with God in his work. 

God had created all living things, but after he created all things, he planted a garden. A garden is different than ‘the woods’. In the woods, in the wild, trees and plants of diverse kinds grow. And, and there's, there's an organic structure. You plant a garden, there's a special design. You, you put the rose beds here and you put the daffodils there and you put the trees in this place. Can you imagine what it was like when God designed a garden \- planted it, how beautiful it must have been? And having planted the garden, He now invites man, Adam, to be a co-laborer with him to join him in the process of tending that garden. God started it and invited us to join him and to collaborate with him in perpetuating it. We are to watch over the garden. To tend and watch over is the words they said. To watch over the physical world, to cultivate it, to steward it in a beneficial manner. To produce those things which are delicious and nutritious, like the fruit of those trees. 

**Economic Sphere 15: Covenantal Blessings and Curses.**   
I'm gonna read selections from Deuteronomy 28:1-6,15-19. If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully obey all his commands, you'll experience all these blessings, your towns and your fields will be blessed. Your children and your crops will be blessed. The offspring of your herds and flocks will be blessed. Your fruit baskets and bread baskets will be blessed. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you'll be blessed... But if you refuse to listen to the Lord your God and do not obey all these curses will come and overwhelm you. Your towns and your fields will be cursed. Your fruit baskets and breadboards will be cursed. Your children and your crops will be cursed. The offspring of your herds and flocks will be cursed. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you will be cursed. 

This makes it really clear that how we experience life is in great measure impacted by the degree to which we adhere to God's ways. When we follow him when we listen to him, when we obey him. Living God's ways results in beneficial results. It results in blessings for society, including economic wellbeing. But disobedience to God's words results in economic disaster. 

Notice all the parallels between these two passages. For every blessing, there's a parallel curse. It's all about \- Do we hear and obey? The Hebrew word for that is **Shema** and it can be translated by both hearing and obeying. Its both listening, but also the action, the application that follows the listening. Perhaps the best word in English to describe that is the rarely used word to ‘heed’. When you heed, you're not only hearing, you're paying attention because you're expecting to have to do what you're listening to. We need to hear God and we need to study the scriptures to learn his principles so that we can apply them to every area of life, including the economic area. 

God's laws are designed for a multifaceted benefit. They impact fields and towns and fruit baskets and herds and flocks and children. It impacts all areas of life. Let's learn to hear and obey God in economics and in every area. 

**Economic Sphere 16: The Sabbath Instituted.**   
Genesis 2:2-3. On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation, so he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and declared Holy because it was the day when he rested from all his work of creation. 

God didn't rest because he was tired. He wasn't exhausted. He wasn’t like, that's so hard, much hard work. I don't have any energy left. No, God rested because he is modeling for us how to have rhythms of productivity and rest, seasons of restoration and renewal and in a regular ongoing way so that we don't burn out, that we can be productive without being burdened. Work is not to be toilsome. There's supposed to be rhythms of work and rest that are modeled by God and imitated by us. The world is not designed by God to be a harsh place that requires tireless labor. 

One of the things of the Wesleyan revival that happened in England was that child labor laws were changed. Children were protected. They shouldn't have to go to work when they're eight or nine years old and work 12 hour days. The amount of hours that you work and the conditions in which you work, all of those things were addressed as a result of a great awakening. When we understand God's ways and character, that he cares for people, he doesn't just see us as machines to produce, to produce produce. Oh no, we are valuable. And so he watches out for us. 

God affirms our finiteness, understands that unlike him, who, as Isaiah 40 says, never gets tired. We do get tired, but we renew our strength as we wait in his presence. And so he authorizes us to, gives us permission, to pause working and to celebrate rest within the framework of life. As society embraces God's rhythm of rest, life does not become a never ending treadmill of relentless work, where you feel like you're just running and running non- stop, and you can never get ahead. Imagine if we took this more seriously, how would it affect the labor laws in your country? How would it change the disciplines in your own family and your own way you do life? Is there something we need to learn more about how to rest and work productively? 

**Economic Sphere 17: Respect Private Property.**   
We read Deuteronomy 19:14. When you arrive in the land, the Lord your God has given you as your special possession you must never steal anyone's land by moving the boundary markers your ancestors set up to mark their property. 

In the book of Genesis, the main verb that we hear in God's mouth when he's speaking and he's describing his own action is the verb “to give”. Of all the things that God does, this is the thing that he highlights the most. He gives again and again and again. And the thing that God gives most frequently in the book of Genesis and throughout the rest of the Original Testament is land. If You obey him and you please him, he kinda says, oh, I'm gonna give you children, and descendants, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you land. From the beginning the story of the Bible of the scriptures affirms the concept of private property. God gives us land. Why does he give it to us? Because it's his land. He made it, he owns it, but he entrusts to us as stewards. This trains us to be responsible and caring for an environment, caring for the world around us. The recognition and protection of private property, land ownership, and by extension of all other private property is a foundational building block of biblical thinking and about healthy society. 

**Economic Sphere 18: Jubilee Laws Established.**   
Leviticus 25:8-34. You should read the whole section, but I'm just gonna read a few highlights. …The 50th year, God says, will be a Jubilee for you, and you must keep it holy. In the year of Jubilee each of you may return to the land that belong to your ancestors. When you make an agreement with your neighbor to buy or sell property, you must not take advantage of each other. The more years until the next Jubilee, the higher the price, the fewer years, the lower price. After all, the person selling the land is actually selling you a certain number of harvests. The land must never be sold on a permanent basis for the land belongs to me, you are only foreigners and tenant farmers working for me. With every purchase of land. You must grant the seller the right to buy it back. But if the original owner cannot afford to buy back the land, it will remain with a new owner until the next year of Jubilee. In the year of Jubilee, the land must be returned to the original owners so they can return to their family land. It is their permanent possession. 

Well, this is an amazing law that God instituted that we don't know if it was ever fully applied in any generation. The idea was this, that every 50 years the land that had been distributed to every tribe and clan and family, people would be able go back to their inheritance. This, this happens like every second generation. It was to, a way to correct periodically multi-generational economic inequities, often created by unwise financial decisions. Say, your grandfather had made some unwise decisions and lost the property. 50 years later, or when that Jubilee came, there would be an opportunity to re-aquire that land. The goal was to level the playing field in such a way that those who were most vulnerable financially could have an opportunity to get a fresh start in economic life. 

God is such a creative realist. He understands that given the passage of time and choices that people make some more diligent and some less diligent, some that maybe suffer an accident or illness that impede them from working to their maximum capacity. So many different circumstances that could happen, that some would prosper more than others. And if that was not had a way of being evaluated and checked to some degree, there would be an endless cycle of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poor. So it was recognized that though private property was affirmed, land ownership was not absolute because really only God is ultimately the owner of all. And we're to live as his stewards, serving as responsible leaseholders. And so we own land for a season. 

For this reason, land ownership needs to be periodically visited so that the, those who do not own land on which to build a home can be given a fresh start. This is both a way of affirming private property, blessing those who have done well, but also a compassion for those who sometimes through decisions made by ancestors, parents or grandparents are finding life more challenging, economically. 

An important thought here is on home ownership. Because that's what this is about. Having a place where you can build a home or cultivate the ground where you have a productive life. And home ownership has multiple end benefits. When a person owns a home, their economic, educational health, even spiritual and worldview benefits, it changes your cultural thinking. You can read more about this in **Sean Lambert's book, the Homes of Hope story. In the economic area alone, he writes that the gift of a basic home as a dramatic effect, helping leverage families out of their current economic situation, a solid sufficient home, both provides both direct and indirect economic benefits. These include the opportunity to use the home for income generating purposes, small businesses serving the needs of the community. The periodic opportunity to start afresh economically gave Israel’s society a way to address extreme poverty and help not only the poor, but the whole community to prosper.** 

I think it's really important as we read these biblical stories to remind ourselves that much of the economy was built on agrarian functions \- the farmers and the sheep herders, goat herders and those who were involved in animal husbandry. And it was out of the family-based businesses that society was developed. In fact, as we come into the New Testament, the word for a household was the **XXXX** and the manager of the household, the steward that he is multiple parables about stewards or household managers is called the **XXXX**. The, the household steward, **XXXXX** is the Greek word from which we get the English word economist. Because, see, businesses began at the household level. What the Jubilee law was about was not about huge corporations, but making sure that every family had an opportunity to have land, have a home and have a foundational means for production. It wasn't a guarantee that they would stay,  that they developed that to the maximum, but gave them an opportunity if they were wise in diligent that they could develop a financial foundation for themselves and for future generations and move towards economic stability. God really cares about this area. 

**Economic Sphere 19\. Integrity in The Marketplace.**   
This is based on Leviticus 19:35-36. Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length, weight or volume. Your scales and weights must be accurate. Your containers for measuring dry materials, all liquids must be accurate. I am the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 

One way to acknowledge God's redemption in our lives is to live with economic integrity. If you are a Jesus follower, there is no room for lying or cheating or stealing. None of these things are appropriate for those who have been brought out of slavery, slavery to sin by the hand of God. See, it's so interesting that these instructions about integrity in economic activity are have punctuated at the end, by God saying, remember, I'm the guy who saved you. You were slaves, you had no economic good. And the fact that you have opportunities for economic activities is because of my doing, and so do it right. Do it right. And you'll see those who feel oppressed by the system are often tempted to lie and cheat and steal because all the system is stacked against them. If we're gonna follow God, we recognize that these actions are characteristic of unredeemed slaves. And so we need to act like a redeemed free persons who have been trained by God. Think of the applications: false advertising, cutting corners, deceptive practices are all all kinds of things that need to be shunned by Christians who are involved in business. 

Sometimes people are harsher and have a different standard, a lower standard for what is acceptable in business than what they would do in a relationship with a friend. They say, oh well that's just business. Like it's okay to try to, you know, cheat and get as much out of it outta this relationship. I can use this relationship as much as I can because that's just business. That's not just kingdom business. Kingdom business is filled with integrity. 

**Economic Sphere 20: Laws Against Overcharging.**   
This is taken from Leviticus 25:35-37. If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and cannot support himself, support him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident and allow him to live with you. Do not charge interest or make a profit at his expense. Instead, show your fear of God by letting him live with you as your relative. Remember, do not charge interest on money you lend him or make a profit on food you sell him. 

Usury or price gouging or unrestrained profiteering and circumstantial extortion are to be absolutely avoided by those who seek to follow Jesus in the realm of economics. There are limits to the law of supply and demand. They’ll say, well, if the law supply and demand, if I can charge this much, why not charge this much? 

I remember as a young adult, when the refugees were fleeing Vietnam... Today, this generation we talking about that millions have had to flee Ukraine because of Russian invasion. And it seems at different points of time there are wars or natural disasters that cause a great of upheaval in people's lives and they need to flee. They become foreigners or temporary residents in another part of the world. Exactly like this passage is talking about. And it's always appear that in those circumstances, there are people who try to profit unmercifully off them. 

I remember the story of these dear Boat People who were fleeing Vietnam and were risking their lives, many were dying and they'd come to shore and there were people selling them water for just horrific amounts, a hundred dollars for a couple liters of water. It was just, people were desperate. They had been at sea for days and they would give anything and everything, but it was just so unjust. This is what it's talking about. 

We should not overcharge. When people are in need, you don't follow the law of supply and demand. You follow the, the war Royal law of love. And you think, how would I like to be treated in this situation? If I was uprooted, if I was cast out of my home and how would I show compassion? 

When we think about the setting the price for our goods and services, maximizing your profit is not the only absolute bottom line. Not if you're a follower of Jesus. There’s a social responsibility. There's relational context that you must take into account. 

Again consider war refugees, those in economic disasters. Don't profit from another's misfortune. Don't take advantage of another person's hard luck story. Let compassion guide you. It says this \- so amazing \- says allow him to live with you \- let him live with you as your relative. This is the scripture. In other words, when to treat the disadvantaged and the economically vulnerable as if they were family members. 

You know, the first time the word refugee was coined was in Geneva. As people were fleeing religious persecution in France, they crossed the border, came into Switzerland. If you go to Geneva today, the top floor of many of the old houses in the center of town here, the houses were three or four stories tall, and then there's a fourth or a fifth story and you look at it and you can see house after house, that that top floor is a different architecture. It's a different color of stone. It's a different style. And what, why are those? Why is that top floor different? When the refugees flooded into Geneva at that time, people built an additional floor on top of that house. So they could welcome the foreigner. They could take them into their home. They were, there was this time of this great revival, this great awakening during the time of the reformation. And they listened to Leviticus 25 and they actually did it. They treated the foreigner like family members. And that's why, even to this day, Geneva is the center of the international Red Cross, a place that symbolizes, an organization that symbolizes compassion for those who are at going through really tough times. It was birthed there. As people try to follow the law of God and apply economic principles to care for the disadvantaged. 

**Economic Sphere 21: Jesus Cleanses the Temple of Merchants.**   
Mark 11:15-17. When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves. And he stopped everyone from using the temple as a marketplace. He said to them, the scriptures declare my temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have turned it into a den of thieves. 

Wow. This is a strong passage. And here's the bottom line takeaway. We are not to profit financially from religious activities. Religion should never be a money making enterprise. 

What had happened at the temple, people needed to have the sacrifices, but they had, these merchants had been in cahoots with the religious leaders and the only animals that were acceptable to be sacrificed were ones that you bought on the temple ground. You could be sure that those were right animals that did not have the defect, that they met all the standards. But to buy a dove or sheep in the temple grounds cost way more than buying that same animal outside of the temple grounds. And everyone was taking a cut. People who are wanting to get right with God and make sacrifices were being overcharged. And Jesus said that should not be. 

Though religious workers worthy of his wages \- we read this in Luke 10:7, and 1 Timothy 5:18 \- it is most inappropriate to profit from religion. This is exemplified in the story of Micah and the Levite whose religious services were available to the highest bidder. You can read about the this in Judges 17 and 18\. He sold his religious services to Micah for 10 sheckles and a shirt initially. But when the Danites came and offered him a bigger title and a higher pay, he just shifted his loyalty from Micah to the Danites. He was doing religion, not to please God or serve people, but just to advance his economic wellbeing. And that was deplorable. And the scriptures say, as a result, everyone was doing right in their own eyes. This was not God's ways. 

You can also read the story of Gehazi, Elijah's servant who, when Elijah God used Elijah to do a wonderful miracle in the life of the foreign general Naman and heal him of leprosy. Naman wanted to give him a present, wanted to give him an offering? Elisha said, no, I'm not going profit from God's miracle. I didn't do it. It was God, you're not paying me. It's it's God. So serve God. 

And Naman went away and Gehazai thought we've just missed an opportunity to make a buck. And he ran after him and lied and said, actually, you know, the prophet sent me to and we could, he give some money and he took a whole bunch of money and you can read about this story in 2 King's chapter five, it was disastrous. Gehazai ends up with Naman's leprosy. You don't want to do this. 

Gehazai's greedy dishonesty stood in contrast to Elisha's generous integrity. Financial gain is never the motive of true religion. In fact, Paul warns Timothy to be aware of people of corrupt mind who've been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain. Or as another translation says who see godliness as just a way to become wealthy. 1 Timothy 6:5. We're not in the religion for the money we can make from it. If you are, you are likely to be categorized with those people of a corrupt mind and are not really people of faith. 

There's an interesting book by Jerry Bower called the Maker versus The Takers. And he notes that Jesus never has a single confrontation about wealth while in Galilee. Every one of his confrontations, like the one with the money changers that we began this segment with over wealth occurs in or near Judea. And they grow in intensity as he becomes closer to, and finally enters the Jerusalem, the seat of political and religious power. Jesus consistently critiques the centralized politicized crony economy He encounters in the capital city and not the decentralized entrepreneurial economy of Gallilee. We can't do economic activity that requires of people things that are not just. And that was what was happening in Jerusalem and the temple and Jesus would not stand for it. We need to be people of truth and integrity and financial compassion. 

**Economic Sphere 22: God Gives the Farmer Wisdom.**   
This is taken from Isaiah 28:24-29. Does a farmer always plow and never sow? Is he forever cultivating the soil and never planting? Does he not finally plant his seeds \- Black cumin, cumin, wheat, barley, and emmer wheat each in its proper way, and each in its proper place? The farmer knows just what to do, for God has given him understanding. 

For God, has given him understanding.

A heavy sledge is never used the thresh black cumin; rather, it is beaten with a light stick. A threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin; instead, it is beaten lightly with a flail. Grain for bread is easily crushed, so he doesn't keep on pounding it. He threshes it under the wheels of a cart, but he doesn't pulverize it. The Lord of Heavens Armies is a wonderful teacher and he gives the farmer great wisdom. 

Don't you love this? This passage teaches us that agricultural knowledge and skill is considered great wisdom given by God, who in this regard is considered a wonderful teacher. God has given him understanding. God's teaching is not limited or restricted to the religious arenas of life. It's not just about what happens on Sundays, but what happens in the church village, what happens on the farm every day of the week as the farmer goes about his business. His teaching in this instance has to do with art and science of farming resulting in economic wellbeing. How to do each crop differently, how to know when to plant and when to reap. Wow. God is amazing. And the knowledge that human beings have acquired from understanding God's creation is amazing as well. We should honor these economic activities.

**Economic Sphere 23: Worship When There is Abundant Provision**   
This passage and the next one, number 24, deal with two related issues. This one is about Worship when There is Abundant Provision. Joel 2:23-26: ...Rejoice in the Lord your God\! For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness. Once more the autumn rains will come, as well as the rains of spring. The threshing floors will **\[be\]** again be piled high with grain, and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil. The Lord says, "I will give you back what you lost to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts, the stripping locusts and the cutting locusts. It was I who sent this great destroying army against you. Once again, you'll have all the food you want and you will praise the Lord your God who does these miracles for you. 

So in this passage, there's a call to worship and praise because of God's great provision. And the next passage is going to be a call to praise and worship when there is no provision. So we are  to be able to be grateful to God and acknowledge him in any and every economic circumstance. So when things are going well, remember he's the one who sends the rain. He's the one who makes it possible. Worship him. 

**Economic Sphere 24: Worship When There is No Provision**  
And now for number 24: Worship When There is No Provision. The exact opposite of 23\. Habakkuk 3:17-18. Even though the fig trees have no blossom and there are no grapes on the vines, even though the olive crop fails and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the Lord. 

See our worship of God and our relationship with him is not dependent upon how well we are doing financially. He doesn't love us more when things are going well, and doesn't love us less when things are going poorly. There are different circumstances that come and go in everyone's life as individuals or societies. Praise God when you are thriving economically and praise him in the midst of economic scarcity. 

Acknowledge God's flawless character, even when circumstances are difficult. He’s not the source of those difficulties. He's the provider of life and good things. And when those are hard to come by, just keep trusting him. He is for you. 

**Economic Sphere 25: Provision for Widows, Orphans and Refugees.**   
This is from Deuteronomy 24:17-22. True justice must be given to foreigners living among you and to orphans, and you must never accept a widow's garment as a security for her debt... When you are harvesting your crops and forget to bring in a bundle of grain from your field, don't go back to get it. Leave it for the foreigners, orphans and widows... Leave the remaining olives for the foreigners, orphans and widows... Leave the remaining grapes for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. Remember that you were slaves of the land of Egypt. That is why I'm giving you this command. 

The bottom line of business, whether it is a small enterprise of self-employment, your own little shop or activity or large corporation. The bottom line goes far beyond making a profit. 

Michael Schluter and David Lee of the Jubilee Centre at Oxford have written a book called The R factor. It develops a whole thinking about a foundations for economics is really related in relationship. Relationship is the foundational reality of the universe. God the father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit lived in a flawless community of fellowship and an intimate, loving relationship before the world was created. So the very foundation of the universe is not the atom or the molecule, or it's not matter. The foundation of the universe is relationship. And so if we are going to do economics, right, it needs to be a relationship centered economy. That's the R factor- recognizing that God is a relational being and created us for relationship with himself and with one another. 

So this sphere of economics and every sphere must seek to advance relational wellbeing within our society. A commitment to relational, social responsibility is essential in a God-inspired economy  Caring for the least advantage and those living on the economic margins of society must be everyone's concern. Foreigners, refugees, displaced persons, orphans, and widows people without the security of family structures are symbolic of those who are economically more vulnerable than the rest. These deserve special care. Why? God reminds the Israelites why. Because once that was what they were. 

If we go back in our family lines, all of us at some points \- whether it's been recent or more distant times, all of us have been slaves or all of us have been in some economic oppressed, disadvantaged situation. And because of that story, that all of us share individually or culturally, we must be compassionate toward those who currently are disadvantaged. So now that you are better off, God is saying, don't forget where you came from. Many dream the dream of going from rags to riches. Wherever you are along that journey between rags and riches, remember those who still are in rags and give them a helping hand. 

For this reason, this passage and the laws of gleaning are so powerful. You're not trying to maximize every penny. You're not trying to get every little head of grain into your barn. You leave a portion of the field for others to glean. That means they can come and harvest after your main harvest is done. You're not looking to capture a hundred percent of the profit. If you get 90%, that's fine enough. Leave 10% for others. And, this is a wonderful way of giving a helping hand, because it's not just a handout. It's an opportunity for a dignified, dignity- giving labor. People who had need could come and harvest and be productive and cultivate for themselves and have a sense of self worth. It was not just a governmental handout, but it was something that every landowner, every businessman, every entrepreneur who was growing food and grains and fruit could assist in. This was a neighbor to neighbor, a community-wide way of really adjusting and impacting the economic realities of a society. This is caring where it really counts. 

**Economic Sphere 26: Let My People Go.**   
Exodus 2:23-25. ...But the Israelites continue to groan under their burden of slavery. They cried out for help, and their cry rose up to God. God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He looked down on the people of Israel and he knew it was time to act. 

People often misread and misinterpret the scriptures. Though slavery is often mentioned in the Bible, it is never expressed as something which is God's will. When we read the scriptures, we need to always remind ourselves that it contains both descriptive and prescriptive material. Descriptive material are those passages which describe how things were. And for most of history, many things happened that were not according to God's will, just like it is today. They were describing the reality of a broken world that needed the touch of God's redeeming work. 

The other passages that are prescriptive, in which God tells us what he wants us to do, in which commands and instructions are given. And in those passages, God describes a world of what it could be. It's not what it is. And it's not what it ought to been, the original design, but it's what it can be. And if we set our hearts, we can will to make it be. 

So these are very important concepts. And when we read the scriptures carefully, we see that God never endorses slavery. He wants freedom for everyone \- Every kind of freedom, economic freedom, spiritual freedom, educational freedom, governmental political civic, freedom, all different kinds of freedoms. People sometimes in the New Testament, read passages in a cursory or quick, uh, reading without giving some thought or implicational thinking, could lead you to think that they were endorsing slavery. 

When you read thoughtfully, Paul uses language that leads to the abolishing of slavery. Let me read to you from Ephesians chapter six. It says slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ… When you read that verse, you think my goodness, he's just perpetuating slavery. He's condemning them to lifelong servanthood. How could he possibly do that? But wait, just a minute, he doesn't stop there. You have got to read it in context. And after speaking to the slaves and how they should relate to the masters, then he says, masters, treat your slaves in the same way. What? The slaves are supposed to obey their earthly masters with deep respect and fear, and masters are to treat their slaves in the same way. If you treat the slave the way you expect the slave to treat you, he's no longer a slave, he's a brother. You’re family, you're equals, you're peers. Paul takes what is expected language, because that was, that was the attitude in the Roman world and the Greek world, among the Jewish people that slaves were inferior and they had responsibility toward the masters, but masters could do whatever they wanted to. 

And he goes, he starts off with what is the known or expected cultural norms and then turns the table. That they kept going and masters need to treat the slaves the same way slaves are supposed to treat their masters. That changes the worldview. He doesn't throw a revolution. He doesn't charge in the streets and burn buildings. What he does is he changes thinking. He changes the pre- suppositions and undermines the institution of slavery once and for all time. 

Just in case you didn't get it, he goes on in that same passage to say, remember you both \- that’s slaves and free \- have the same master in heaven. And he has no favorites. God doesn’t prefer masters over slaves or slaves over masters. They're equal in his eyes. So you must be equal in one another's eyes and you must treat each other as peers who have all made in the image of God, all who have sinned and fallen short and all who can be redeemed by the grace of God and enter into fellowship with him. What a tremendous word we have. 

When we talk about how we engage in economic activities \- and there are people at all different levels of advantage and disadvantage across our societies and the various nations all around the world \- Do we have this attitude that all are equal? All are valuable, all are God's image?. And we should treat all the exactly the same way? If we do, we're starting to learn God's principles for economic integrity. 

**Economic Sphere 27: Paul Appeals for Onesimus' Freedom.**   
You find this book in Philemon verses 10-19. There's only one chapter. Philemon was known to Paul and was a wealthy person, one of the leaders of the church in Colossi to which the letter of Colossians was written. And he was a slave owner as most wealthy people were in the Roman world. Onesimus had been his slave, and Onesimus had run away. And that was a crime that punishable by death within the Roman system. But when Onesimus ran away, he came to faith. Apparently, Paul preached to him. And he came to love Jesus. And he served Paul and Paul actually sends Onesimus back with **\_\_\_\_\_** who carries the letter to Colossi and this letter to Philemon at the same time, And, who's an elder in the church and appeals for Philemon to free Onesimus, not to execute him. This is what he says. 

I appeal to you to show kindness to my child. Paul writes as if he was a family member, which he is because of what Jesus has done. I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus... It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever. He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he'll mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me. 

When Paul writes this, he's aware that Onesimus' running away had produced financial loss for Philemon. He wants to bring them to reconciliation. He wants Onesimus to be free, but he doesn't want Philemon to suffer as a result of it. So he's willing to share the cost. He says, charge it to me. I'll pay you whatever money you lost as a result of his inappropriate departure. He is now coming back to you as a fellow believer, like you and I are. So we see him as a brother. Paul loves Onesimus and wants his freedom, but he also loves Philemon and does not want him to be harmed economically. 

You know, when there's social injustice, it's really easy to take one side and hate the other side. You defend the oppressor and accuse the oppressed, or you defend the oppressed and accuse the oppressor. And societal change is costly. Systems are disrupted and lives are involved. And Paul is willing to advocate for change, but he loves people on both sides of the story and is willing to personally help cover the cost to make that change work. 

That is just a absolutely wonderful example for all of us. He doesn't pit one person against another or one group against another. He advocates for all and promotes a gospel in which, and I am going to quote from Colossians 3:11. Remember this is the church that of which Philemon was a leader. I can imagine that when they walked into the church service **t\_\_\_** and Onesimus. **T\_\_\_** comes out and reads this letter, Colossians, first and afterwards, hands Philemon the private letter about Onesimus. And so what does he say to the whole church and what is still buzzing in Philemon's ears? He said the gospel and the gospel. It doesn't matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric and civilized, slave or free, Christ is all that matters. And he lives in all of us. He lives in all of us. So we have to a treat one another with the same equal respect and dignity and value. There is no foundation for hierarchies or distinctions or divisions that say some are better and some are worse. All are valuable, all need to be served as the gospel effects change and our pre-gospel societal arrangements. What a wonderful way he does this. It's radical, it's earth changing, but it's gentle and caring for all involved in this process of change. 

**Economic Sphere 28: Jehoshaphat's Ungodly Partnership.**   
We read this in 2 Chronicles 20: 35-37. Sometime later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who was very wicked. Together they built a fleet of trading ships in the port of Ezion-geber. Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, "Because you have allied yourself with King Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy your work." So the ships met with disaster and never put out to sea. 

God cares about whom you do business with. Sometimes people say, well, it's just business, that’s just the way it is \- as a way of discounting certain ethical considerations. But there is nothing we do on earth that is not of interest to God. Like King Ahaziah of Israel was evil. God is interested if we are compromising our morals, our ethical standards to partner with ungodly people. 

Jehoshaphat was for the most part, a really good king. He did a lot of things right. He pleased the Lord. But he made a really bad business decision. And God would not allow these ships to achieve what they intended to do. When you read the parallel passage in Kings it says they were met with the storm in the sea and all the ships and the gold that they had intended to bring back were, were sunk and all the investment and all the business hopes were destroyed because God could not support this partnership where they were unequally yoked, a righteous king and a wicked king. So if we don't have the right partners, our business endeavors will not experience the blessing of God. 

In a similar way John, the apostle warns against partnering with false teachers by supporting them again financially, or offering them hospitality, help covering their housing costs. He warns them 3 John 10-11 don't invite that person into your home. (This is the false teacher, the wicked teacher) or give any kind of encouragement. Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work. 

When you contribute financially to someone else, you become a partner with them. Whether it's Jehoshaphat with another king, from king to king, or if it's as a church person and supporting a false teacher, financial partnerships with an economic support of evil people make us accomplices in their evil work and wrong doing. So the principle here is \- choose your partners carefully. Make sure that you share a common worldview, that they have a kingdom mentality, and they're willing to walk in the ways of God if you're going to do business together with them. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
Okay, this next section we're gonna be looking at contains 15 different passages, and it's entitled Economics Do's and Don'ts. It's gonna be a really fun section because we're getting very, very practical. This is when God's truth and his principles become to \- down to the point of application of life transforming changes, practices that make a difference in person's individual lives, in their families, and in society.  
**Economic Sphere 29: Do Not Steal**  
our title is Do Not Steal, and the reference is Deuteronomy 5:19. And it says, You must not steal. Very short verse. And there's a lot of content. This is the eighth commandment of the 10 Commandments, and it's found both here in Deuteronomy five and in Exodus 20. And what's interesting in both of these passages, the Hebrew word is— the command imperative \- is in the singular. This is something that you as an individual, I as an individual, anyone who's watching this as an individual must understand and apply. But later on in Leviticus 19:11, there's also the command- You must not steal \-but it's in the plural. So as you look through the whole of the scriptures, it has applications, both individual and corporate, both private and communal. And so this is something at every level we need to understand.   
Now, there's some things that are implicit in this that are important to get, but it's important to understand it's not just a passage in the Original Testament. Jesus quotes this, and in Matthew 19 and Mark 10 and Luke 18, he quotes this command and Paul picks it up in Roman 13:9. This is a very important thing for us to grasp. There's lots that is implied. When you say you must not steal, it indicates that there is separate domains, domains of authority. There's private personal property, and I must respect your property and steward well my property. This is all implied.   
When you listen to a little child learning to speak, one of the first words that you hear are two-year-olds say, is mine, mine, mine\! But you have to understand as we mature, we need to understand not only what is mine, but that which is not mine. And how we respect other people and their ownership of not only things but ideas, concepts, strategies, practices, frameworks. There are lots of different ways that ownership is expressed, both in tangible and intangible realities. And we as individuals need to respect the ownership that others have. It's important to understand how this works.   
This is part of the, as I said, the 10 Commandments. And the 10 Commandments is not just a hodgepodge of dos and don'ts. The word “Torah” in Hebrew, which is translated “law”, can rightly be translated, also “teaching". In fact, it has more to do with a classroom than it does with the courtroom. It's more about instruction than it is about judicial procedures and instruction for life. And so as you go through these commandments, they speak of an increasingly more abstract ways. The horizontal Commandments, the last six ones talk about, first of all, honoring your father and mother. That's because they, whatever else they do in their life, they've given you the most important thing that you ever have. They give you life. They might be idolators, they might be wicked people, they might be abusive people, but just the fact that they've given you life makes them honor worthy. Life is the ultimate good.   
So if you understand that, then the next foundation is don't \- do not kill. Don't take be a life- taker. Honor life-givers. Don't be a life-taker. Then it talks about do not commit adultery. Don't take that which is the most precious in someone's life, the relationship with their spouse, by violating the trust of intimacy.  
So from those points, we get to this eighth command: Do not steal. Well, what does stealing have to do with life? If I steal you a television, it's not a living thing. Why? Why is that important to understand? Well, actually, when you steal a television, you're stealing more than just the object. You're stealing the hours that a person worked to earn the money in order to be able to buy that television. You're not taking all of their life, like you do in murder, or the most precious part of their life when you take their wife. But you're taking a segment of their life and that is destroying, that’s diminishing the quality of life. And that is very significant. So because things are, and ideas and elements that are products of human life are valuable because they come from human beings. And God has made us in his image and his likeness. Because of that, we have an intrinsic value. And so we respect people's belongings because in doing so, we respect them.   
See, God is a life giver. And if we’re to be his followers, we are to be life-givers too, not life- takers. Sometimes in the area of economics, we think of something has value because of the laws of supplying demand. And certainly if there's a glut of product and little interest, the cost will go down. But there's something more fundamental than the law of Supply and Demand.  
Some things are more valuable than other things because more life has been invested in it. So for example, a Boeing jumbo jet is more valuable than this cup that I have with coffee in it. Okay? Why? Well, a lot more life goes into building a plane, hundreds and hundreds of people. And before you start the actual construction- engineers and construction and design and architecture and science and research, all the elements of economics that go into it, the science and technology, not just the business side. There's just myriads, myriads of hours that have gone into creating this.   
A cup doesn't take nearly as much time to make. It might take a few people a few minutes. And so the value of one is greater because more life has been invested into it. So this is why, why it is so important that we understand the value of things because they represent the life of those who made those things. And this is very important for us to understand in the economic sphere.   
This phrase “Do not steal” is also at times used in the Hebrew as the same phrase as to not kidnap. If you steal, you can steal someone away from their family. You might not be taking all of their life because they've already lived part of their life, but you've kidnapped them and enslaved them. And again, the idea is that you are, you are violating a portion of their life just as if you are also taking their television.   
So these are important things for us to understand. They're foundational for society to work. We respect other people's things, their ideas, their products, because we respect their life. Life is valuable and we're life-givers, not life-takers.   
When we remind ourselves that this command is not only for the individual for but also for the corporate, it helps us understand its application for the economic sphere. We need to make sure that in business, everything we do in the business place, in the workplace is adding to life, not reducing life. We're not robbing anyone in the whole \- from the production process sequence to the marketing sales \- We’re not taking from people, but we're enhancing their lives. That's what true biblical business is about. It's not taking life, but enhancing life, creating products and services that add to life, not that subtract from life.  
**Economic Sphere 30: Work or Don't Eat.**  
I want to read from 2 Thessalonians 3:6-12…Stay away from all believers who live idle lives and don't follow the tradition they received from us. For you know that you ought to imitate us. We were not idle when we were with you. We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it. We worked hard day and night, so we would not be a burden to any of you. We certainly had the right to ask you to feed us, but we wanted to give you an example to follow. Even while we were with you, we gave you this command: Those who unwilling to work will not get to eat. Yet we hear that some of you are living idle lives, refusing to work… We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their… living.   
In the scriptures work is a constructive, positive, good thing. It is part of God's design. It's his purpose. We're designed to be productive and fruitful. Now there's work that is tedious and humdrum that is, that is not part of God's original design, but he's designed us to really give ourselves, to discover our gifts and give ourselves wholeheartedly towards an employment that would make a difference in the world. He designed us to be steward of our environment and to facilitate the provision for our families and contribute to our communities. We need to cultivate a biblical work ethic. Diligence and hard work are to be highly valued. It is not un-spiritual working nine to five, if you're doing what you are gifted to do and doing it in obedience to God is not unscriptural. It is in fact very spiritual is what God designed us to be able to do. And we need to do everything that we do to bring glory to him.   
Let's go back to the 10 Commandments for just a minute. The fourth commandment we often think of the commandment of the Sabbath rest. And it is true that in that fourth commandment, it does end with saying “On the seventh day you shall rest.” But actually there are two commands in that fourth commandment. And the first one is this: work for six days. And we kind of forget that. We often have theological debates and you know, how do we do sabbath? How strict are we? What day is it? What what is allowable? What is not allowable? The point is we're to work six days. We’re to be productive contributors to our society and providing for our families. And then we are to take a break. It's not all about work, but it's certainly not all about leisure either.   
We're to cultivate a work ethic that honors sacrifice, diligence, effort, and that produces stuff that benefits the many in our community. God wants us to be diligent, hardworking, productive contributors to society. So if you are employed or you're an employer, you're doing something significant. Keep at it. Do it for the glory of God.   
**Economic Sphere 31: Work So You Can Be A Giver.**   
This comes from Ephesians 4:28. If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need.  
This is a great passage. It begins by talking about those who once lived a life of thievery where they dedicate themselves to taking things from others and to follow Jesus means to learn how to be productive so that you can give things to others. It's a total reversal, 180 degree change. And when people live like this, everyone in the society benefits. We're not to live life as takers. We're to live life as givers, not trying to rob others of what's rightfully theirs, but being able to earn something and to give what is rightfully ours to them. That is transformative, that is in keeping with God's character.   
See, when you look through the scriptures and you look at all the verbs that are associated with God, the second most frequently used verb, if you look at both the Hebrew in the Original Testament and the Greek in the New Testament that describes God's actions is the word ‘give’. God is a giver. The first thing is that he's a communicator, he speaks. And then the second thing is he's a giver. And this is, he's the most generous being in the universe. And as we learn to become his sons and daughters in every sphere of society, we must be the most generous people on earth. He's a giver. We need to be givers too.   
Well over a thousand times, the Bible speaks of God giving. We need to make this just a daily practice. And if we're going to be imitators of God, we have to then be diligent in producing goods that we have a means whereby we can give. And the more we are able to work and be diligent, the more we can give. We can meet our own needs, but also those of others.   
Let's think how we do this both individually and in our families, but also in our businesses. If you are running a business and you want to reflect the kingdom principles, it's not just about making money for yourself and your stockholders or your employees, but it's also how you can make enough money to be able to invest back into the community where you are living or communities across the face of the globe in order to be able to see the kingdom of God extended. We're talking about increasing and multiplying and distributing wealth to the glory of God to make sure that not only our needs but the needs of all those around us are fully met and satisfied.   
**Economic Sphere 32: Tithe Plus.**   
That may shock you because just giving the tithe for many may seem like an impossible thing to do, but that is just the lowest entry level form of giving. Let's read Matthew 23:23-24. It says this, Jesus is talking to the religious leaders of his day. What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites\! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens, but you ignore the more important aspects of the law \- justice, mercy, and faith. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things. Blind guides\! You strain your water so that you won't accidentally swallow a gnat, but instead you swallow a whole camel\!   
In this passage and its parallel in Luke chapter 11 are the only two places in the New Testament where Jesus speaks about the tithe. And he doesn't discard it. He recognized that they're tithing even the mint in their garden. So out of every 10 mint leaves, one mint leaf goes to God. Nine mint leaves are for my tea. I mean this is like very precise tithing. But sometimes they got so lost of the particular, the logistics of tithing they forgot the really important things. So he is not discounting tithing, but he wants us to think of the fullest impact. He affirms it, he says it's right, but there's a lot more that is needed.   
Tithe \- 10% \- is the bottom line, entry level, minimal standard of giving. And it's actually not just 10% because in the Original Testament there are three tithes that are required. Two are given annually. So that's 20%, 10% plus 10%. And the third was given every third year, for the poor needy. It was a tithe for compassion for mercy ministries for the widow, the stranger, the poor, the needy, the refugees.   
So at that tithe was what is spoken about in Malachi when God says, bring your your tithes into the storehouse to care for the poor and needy. And so if you distribute that third tithe over those three years, people are expect to give 23.33%. Almost one fourth of their income was for God ordained purposes, God established purposes. And then, only then, did you start giving gifts. Free will offerings happen after 23%. So God models generosity in his own life, but it sets a standard for his people to be unlike other people were to be more radically generous than anyone else on earth.   
What things, what areas can you give in? It's not just about financial giving, but are there things that you can do that contribute to your community, address issues of injustice that display mercy or compassion or other social engagements? Is it, what can you do as an individual, as a company, as a business in this area so that you are investing in others and not just hoarding for yourself?   
When we think about tithe, we should think about it as an obligation. In our financial dealings, we often think about obligations, needs and wants, and it’s a hierarchy of priority of, in which we spend our money. We don't buy things to supply our ones before we meet our financial obligations. We meet our obligations first and then when we've done that, obligations are things that you've contracted for. If you have a monthly payment to, for a rental of a house or a mortgage or for paying your electricity or your phone bill, those are obligations that you took on. And so you pay for those things first. And then when there's, after you've done that, you have needs, you need food and you need some transportation money and you need some clothing and some of these things, then you can take care of those needs. And then when your needs are covered, then there's time to take care of your wants \- to watch a movie or do something else like that.   
But we get things out of balance, either as individuals or families or as companies when we put our wants ahead of our obligations. And the first obligation of all is the obligation to give financially to the things that God has told us to give \- these tithes and our offerings. So we always begin there.   
Sometimes people say, well, I don't have enough to be able to give to God first. Well, that's exactly the problem. If we've taken care of other things first, we will never have enough to give to God. But if we start with a tithe, we start with giving, 23.3% or/and beyond \-it’s tithe plus.   
Then that point of generosity is a point of transformation. That's how we can do business. That's how we can do economics. That's how we can do our finances at any level of society in a transformative way that is in contrast to the society around us. How can you in your place of employment, do more for the kingdom of God, exhibiting the generosity, the justice, the mercy and faith that you want to see demonstrated through your life and through your company.   
**Economic Sphere 33:  Be Diligent.**   
We're gonna read from Proverbs 6:6-11. Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones\! Learn from **your** ways and become wise\! Though they have no prince or governor or ruler to make them work, they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter. But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep? When will you wake up? A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.   
Well the author of this proverbs is addressing himself to lazybones. And I hope that's not you. The scripture calls them people of action, people of diligence, people who are productive and faithful and fruitful, who are self-starting, initiative taking regardless of the circumstances, diligence should be a part of our life, discipline and thoughtful engagement in the affairs of life.   
You don't wait until winter is upon you to start thinking about the food that you need to store for the lean times. That's the imagery of the ants here. You work during the summer with this is easygoing. It's just be lovely to hang out in the grass, and go swim in the pool, but that's when you work hard and you set up provision to have a storehouse full of food and for days of necessity. So diligence is more than just working on hours. It's about being a self-starter. It's about taking initiative, being consistent and disciplined, no matter the circumstances so that you prepare for every eventuality. That's what God calls us to do.   
**Economic Sphere 34: Be Generous.**   
We're gonna read from Proverbs 11:24-25. And you know, as we listen to this, we've already talked multiple times about generosity and we should not tire of this because this is a central theme of the scriptures and one of the distinctive marks of those who are truly the people of God, it sets them apart for the rest of society. It's not only in the sphere of economics, but in every sphere. Generosity is one of the thing that characterizes the kingdom of God. This scripture says, Give freely and become more wealthy; be stingy and lose everything. The generous will prosper; those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed,   
Generosity is God's pathway towards enduring wealth and creating more capacity. To live Godlike is to live generously, to give of yourself to others in time and talents and resources in every way possible. Finances, encouragement, in hope, in acts of service \-  generosity is the hallmark of the follower of Jesus. And generosity always produces and invokes and multiplies more generosity.   
We don't live in a limited circle. If I give something of mine away, it does not mean I'm gonna have less. It just means I have an opportunity to receive more. And for the cycle of virtue, the cycle of generosity to increase more and more.   
You know in the Bible we read about the Dead Sea. You know why the Dead Sea is called dead? Because fish and plants can't live in it. You know why fish and plants can't live in it? Because it is below sea level and all the rivers run into it and no river flows out of it. So all the salts and minerals and chemicals picked up by those rivers are deposited and it's so mineral rich, it chokes life because it just receives and receives and receives and never gives. If you live like that, you're a Dead Sea. If you are all about receiving and getting and taking, but you're not about giving, life will not flourish in you or around you.   
And so it's not only in terms of geographical things like the sea, this is a little more delicate, but think about when you get sick or you get constipated and you're eating and food comes in, but nothing comes out. You feel miserable. We're designed to receive \- live \- giving and receiving. And if we only do the one without doing the other, then we find ourselves very soon in an unhealthy situation. Death sets in. Generosity produces life. Generosity produces more generosity. Generosity is the way we need to live in every aspect of our lives, including this area of economics.   
**Economic Sphere 35: Don’t oppress the Poor.**   
We're gonna read from Proverbs 21:13, which says this, Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will be ignored in their own time of need.   
As we go about our business, as we go about life, as we do the things that we do day to day, nine to five on the job around our communities, we need to live attentive to the needs of others. We can't be so absorbed with meeting our own needs that we overlook those around us who have perhaps greater need.   
When you drive through a new community, you often notice the homeless on the street, but in your own hometown, you become accustomed to seeing this homeless man or that homeless woman on a street corner. And pretty soon you drive by almost don't even notice their existence. We cannot allow ourselves to be desensitized to need. When we stop caring about the most destitute, the most needy, the most marginalized in our community our life suffers, our business suffers, our family suffers. Society suffers.   
The scriptures here tell us that caring for people, caring for them in times of need, caring for them in their distress, caring them for them in the times of brokenness and hopelessness is a, is something that is essential. And if we will do that, God will make sure that in our times of need we do will be cared for. There's a reciprocity that happens within our communities if we cultivate a spirit of generosity within the places where we live.   
We need to think about this in our businesses. It's not just about what we can get from our communities, but what can we give to our communities, our employees, our fellow workers and beyond? And the bigger \- how we see the world around us, the more we can give, the more blessings we're able to bestow and the more blessings we may in turn receive.   
So let's ask ourselves some of these questions. Is there anything I can do to make a difference? What's the greatest need? How can we help? How can we be involved? We're part of a bigger family. It's not just about protecting our own, but how can we care for others around us? Let's not shut our ears to those who are in need.   
**Economic Sphere 36: Put God to the Test.**   
Wow, that sounds like a strange title. You may be thinking of Deuteronomy 6:16 which says, you must never put God to the test. And you might remember when Satan tempted Jesus at the beginning of his ministry, he challenged Jesus to do certain things. And Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 said, do not put God to the test. So what are we doing with the title says, put God to the test? Well, it's because the passage we're looking at is Malachi 3:10-11, which says this, bring all the tithes \-  God is speaking to his people. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there'll be enough food in my Temple. If you do, says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, I will open the windows of heaven to you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have enough room to take it in\! Try it\! Put me to the test\! Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from insects and disease. Your grapes will not fall from the vine before they are ripe, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.   
So again and again throughout the scriptures God says don't put him to a test. Don't test him. Trust him. Don't, don't do this. Until we get to this last book of the Original Testament and God says here now in this one area, I want you to test me. And basically what he's done is he's throwing down the gauntlet and challenging you to a generosity test. He's saying, just try to out-give me. Try it. Go on, see if you can. And he says, you will fulfill the giving that I required of you, asked of you, then you'll see that you'll be, you'll have no need.   
Remember in our passage number 32, we talked about tithe plus, we mentioned this passage in Malachi and how the tithing among the Original Testament was 23 and a and a third percent when you added it all together. It seems like an awful lot to us. But God says, if you will just be generous and give to me and trust me, I guarantee that I \-you will not be able to out-give me.   
So I challenge you. Think about God's challenge. You want to pick up the challenge? You want to run a generosity contest with God? Do this as an individual. Do this as a family. Do this as a church, as a community, as a business. Do this and see how God will give.  
   
**Economic Sphere 37: Idolatrous Efforts to Prosper.**   
And we're gonna read from 2 Kings 21:7-9. The scripture says this, Manasseh and Manasseh is the king that served the longest time in the history of Judah, the southern kingdom- 51 years and is reported as the most evil, the most wicked of all of the kings of Judah. Manasseh, who was king of Judah, even made a carved image of Asherah and set it up in the Temple, the very place where the Lord had told David and his son Solomon: My name will be honored forever in the Temple and in Jerusalem \- the city I've chosen from among all the tribes of Israel. If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands — all the laws My servant Moses gave them — I will not send them into exile from this land that I gave their ancestors. But the people refused to listen, and Manasseh led them to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the Lord had destroyed when the people of Israel into the land.   
Again, Manasseh was the worst king of the southern kingdom. I mean, he didn’t only stray from God, he just brazenly went against God. So when it says that he brought Asherah poles in, these, this was a fertility goddess. So her statuary was like, ancient world pornography. Okay? It was designed to evoke lustful thoughts and immoral acts among the worshipers. And this was placed in the Temple of God, not in some other place that other kings did that (they went to high places) but it was brought in right into the very Temple. And the reason they involved in these cultic sexual rituals in those days was they felt like this was the way they could induce the gods, the pagan gods that they were worshiping to bless them in their crops, that they'd have a greater fertility and greater prosperity. It was about making a sacrifice and about giving themselves to sexuality and lust in the hopes for prosperity and financial gain. It was a, it was a wicked combination of serving the flesh and giving yourself to materialism.   
So they thought as they do this, then their cows would have, bear more calves and they'd be healthier. The lambs would be born to the ewes and kids would be born to the goats and, the harvest would be well. And so the whole agricultural world was centered around these fertility- sexualized fertility rituals.   
We don't do that today, but in today in our cultures, we have similar things. We have sexuality on display everywhere, enticing young and old elect to lustful actions and thoughts. There's always an urging to- for more materialism, more wealth. The American dream where more is always better. And this is be around us at all times. And have we in our culture put some of these goals of pleasure, of materialism, of wealth in the place of God? Have we devoted ourselves to them in a place where we should be worshiping God?  
See, this was right in the Temple where these substitutes idols were replacing true worship. This passage takes some heart searching. Of course, we are not following Asherah poles in the same way Manasseh did. But let's look at our hearts.   
Now when we read on a little bit further in 2Chronicles verse 33, a chapter 33:23, it tells us that the very end of his life Manasseh repented and wrote a prayer of repentance. And, it's a wonderful story of hope that even a very corrupt king can change before his death.   
And his prayer is recorded in a book that is considered,  part of the Bible by several of the Christian traditions, what's called a **XXXXXX** book. It's called, his Prayer is called The Prayer of Manasseh. Let me read you a few words from this book**.** So let me read a few words from this book:   
I have no relief for I provoked your wrath and I've done what is evil in your sight, setting up abominations and multiplying offenses. And now I bend the knee of my heart imploring you for your kindness. I have sinned O Lord, I have sinned and I acknowledge my transgressions. I earnestly implore you. Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me. Do not destroy me with my transgressions. Do not be angry with me forever or stir up evil for me. Do not condemn me to the depths of the earth for you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent.   
What a beautiful prayer. So sincere, I have sinned O Lord, I've sinned and I bend the knee of my heart. You know all of us have lusted after things that we shouldn't have. All of us have tried to find our identity and wealth and possessions in ways that bring distress to God's heart. All of us, like Manasseh, need to bend the knees of our heart so that we return to God and see ourselves as he sees us, created in his image, invited to be sons and daughters, loved by him who walk in his ways with integrity, purity. Instead of a life of lust, a life of purity. Instead of a life of materialism, a life of generosity, and instead of a life of authority \-a life of servanthood. These are the things that God calls you and me to do. And this is what should characterize all our actions in the sphere of economics and every other sphere as well.   
**Economic Sphere 38: No Favoritism Based on Economic Status.**   
We're going to read a few selections from James 2:1-9. My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over others?… If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, you can stand over there or sit on the floor — well, doesn't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?… It is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: Love your neighbor as yourself. But if you favor some people over others, you are committing sin. You are guilty of breaking the law.   
See if we have a double standard, it is always rooted in sin. It never is motivated by love. The royal law of love, as James talks about it, always opposes discrimination, preferring some and despising others. And why do we do that in the economic area? We tend to give all kind of attention and favor towards the wealthy and overlook the poor and the needy. Why? Because we are hoping that if we build relationships with the wealthy, we might benefit, we might become their friends, we might have some of the overflow, it might spill out onto us. And so we're tempted to give some people special treatment because of selfishness, because we're hoping that we get a benefit and others who we don't see that they could possibly contribute anything to our life, they're insignificant. And that friends, is not God's way of seeing the world. He sees each person as valuable.   
One of the parables that I love of Jesus, we know as a parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Lazarus was the homeless guy who went to be with Him in heaven. We know Lazarus by his name. The rich man \- we don't know his name in the parable. Jesus purposely does the opposite of the normal double standard. We all know the names of the rich and the famous. We read about them on the internet. We see them on the news. We, we are, they're the famous and the wealthy and we can say all their names, but we drive by the homeless guy on the street corner and we don't know his name or her name. But in Jesus’ parable it is the homeless one that's named and the wealthy that goes unknown. So he's trying to level the playing field. And we need to care for all people in a similar way, not to treat some better because we might get something from them, but to treat all with dignity and respect. This is the way of the kingdom of God.   
**Economic Sphere 39: Wealth Does Not Equal True Happiness.**   
We're gonna read from Ecc 5:10-15. The scripture says, Those who love money will never have enough. Do you have enough? Do you feel like you don't? Well if you feel like you don’t, you might be loving money too much. Maybe there's time for a little heart check right there. But let's keep reading this passage. How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness\! The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what good is wealth —except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers\! People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much. But the rich seldom get a good night's sleep… We all come to the end of our lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day we are born. We can't take our riches with us.   
We often hear that statement. Did you realize that it was comes from the Bible? There's a lot of truth that is incorporated into our culture that is rooted in the scriptures. And basically what's saying is this, if you're trying to find your contentment, your satisfaction, your value, your worth, in things that you own and material things that you possess, then you are, you're really mixed up. You're have a wrong foundation for values and significance and contentment.   
Really the things, things don't give us value. Things don't give us happiness. What gives us value in happiness is relationships \- relationship with God, relationships with one another, with people \- knowing who you are, made in the image of God and that you're loved and that you're doing the things that God has called you to do. That's what's significant, that's what's valuable.   
And so in the world, people love things and use people, but in the kingdom of God we love people and use things. We keep things in the right perspective. Things are delightful to have when they serve us. But relationships are what is really the most meaningful thing. So let's pursue that which is truly valuable relationship with God and neighbor and love as we ought to love.   
**Economic Sphere 40: Economic Righteousness.**   
We're going to read from Amos 8:4-6. Listen to this, you who rob the poor and trample down the needy\! You can't wait for the Sabbath day to be over and the religious festivals to end so you can get back to cheating the helpless. You measure out grain with dishonest measures and cheat the buyer with dishonest scales. And you mix the grain and sell \- you sell with chaff swept from the floor. Then you enslave poor people for one piece of silver or a pair of sandals.   
The prophet Amos has a scathing rebuke for those who are religious one day of the week and vile the rest of the week. Going to synagogue on Saturday or church on Sunday doesn't give you license to treat others in an economically unjust way the other days of the week. You can't be corrupt economically, taking advantage of people, using them, cheating them, being dishonest with the products that you're selling to them and and just harming them. You can't do that and then show up at a religious service and come off as being good. It doesn't cover it up. True religion, true godliness is expressed in economic integrity and justice and caring for people who are poor and needy. Integrity in business and valuing people is of paramount importance. It is good to go to church, good to go to the synagogue. It's good to seek God's face, but not at the expense of people, not as a substitute for being transformed in the way you do business.   
**Economic Sphere 41: Prayer Impacts Economic Activity.**   
We're gonna be looking at 2 Chronicle 7:13-14. God is speaking. He says the following, At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls or command grasshoppers to devour your crops or send plagues among you. Then if my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sins and I will restore their land.   
There are lots of different reasons why you might have economic hardship. In this passage God says one of the reasons might be that there’s  a divine judgment, that the people have done that which they ought not to have done. And so God is the one who stays the rain, who sends the locusts or the plague. And to get people to think again of what they're doing and turn back to God. And so the God who loves to bless, loves to extend mercy and compassion at times, finds it necessary to exercise judgment in order to call his children to attention. And as he does so, if we are aware of that and we turn back to God in humility and repentance, prayer will change things. When things are going poorly, it's time to ask the question, have we forgotten God? Have we strayed from the ways of God? What do we need to do to make things right with God? And turn in humility and pray.  
You know, things can be rough in business for many, many reasons. Don't always just think, well, sales are down. We need a new media strategy. We need a new advertising firm. We gotta get more salesmen. We gotta do this, we gotta do that. Maybe you need to do some of those things, but maybe, just maybe you need to say, have we lost sight of God and his ways? Do we need to turn back to him? Do we need to pray? Maybe prayer is the place to begin? And then the advertising agency might need to be changed as well.   
But Seek God's face first. There may be something he wants to correct or adjust. He may be using this time of difficulty to get your attention, to draw you into a greater place of intimacy so that you can listen to him, align yourself with him, work with him, and go forward with him. God will lead you as you seek his face. He's a kind God. He's a generous God. He executes judgment only when absolutely necessary. He loves to bless. He loves to extend mercy and compassion. He wants to be on your side, but you must decide, will you be on his side? Will you align yourself with his ways? And that's what this passage is all about. We must make sure that our businesses are centered on the ways of the kingdom of God. And then we'll have God's blessing follow us.   
God loves answering prayers that are sincere. He loves coming to your aid and bringing change and assistance, give you wisdom and strategies if we listen to him. So seek God, find out if there's something he wants to say to you. And repent. Embrace humility. Admit you've gone done it wrong. And set yourself on the right path. God loves to bring blessing and help.   
**Economic Sphere 42: Build. Plant. Pray.**   
Jeremiah 29: 4-7. This is a letter that Jeremiah who was in Jerusalem wrote to the exiles who have \-are in Babylon that had been deported there under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar. As refugees, as conquered people, obviously they were longing to return home and abandon Babylon and go back to Jerusalem. But this letter, he tells them to do something that was unexpected for them. He says, this is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem. Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. Marry and have children. Then find spouses for those so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply\! Do not dwindle away\! And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. And that is Babylon\!. You know, pray for the peace and prosperity of that city. Pray to the Lord for it, for in, its welfare will determine your own welfare.   
Wow, what a counterintuitive, revolutionary, transformational idea this is. Let me review with you just some of the words that he said in this passage. He tells 'em to build, plan, plant, eat, marry, multiply, work, pray. In other words, do life. Put down your roots. Be normal. Embrace this situation and make the most of it. Even though you've thought of the Babylonians as your enemies, invest where's planted you.   
If you are always looking for, I could be a real success if I just had a better circumstance. It's never going to happen. You know, it’s \- whatever you are, there's always adversity around us. There are always an less than ideal situation, but God calls us to care for the community wherever you are. To bloom where you're planted, to use a more contemporary term, to do the normal things of life. Build homes, plant gardens, eat your food, get married, have children, multiply, work. These things, these basic things of life are good. This is what we're supposed to do as human beings. These are good things. They're important things. This is God, what God expects people to do. God approves of these things and he encourages them.   
Sometimes we think, oh, I just wanna do spiritual things. You know, all of these things are spiritual. These are the things that the Spirit of God is asking people to do. There's value in all of these normal day-to-day activities that fill most people's life, most of the time. These, the area of economics, the areas of the different spheres of society. So give yourself to the wellbeing of the city where you live. Seek the common good. If you do, you'll become what the original testament Hebrews calls a XXXXX or the plural, XXXXX. That means the righteous one or the godly ones.   
There's a wonderful passage in Proverbs 11:10. It says, the whole city celebrates when the godly, that's the XXXX, succeed. Now, you know, that's very unusual. Usually we only rejoice when we succeed or our team succeeds. Rarely do I rejoice when you or somebody else's team succeeds. What is it about the XXXXX? This Hebrew concept of the righteous that is different from the world's way of thinking? When they succeed the whole city rejoices. Why? Because the XXXX don't only live for themselves. They live for the wellbeing of their community. They give of themselves for the wellbeing of the common good. And so when they're successful at that, everyone benefits. So everyone rejoices. If we are truly being God's people in the communities, the towns, the neighborhoods, the cities, the nations where we live, we succeed. The whole of our community succeeds with us. And there will be great rejoicing.   
This is \- will happen as we do that in the area of business or in any of the other spheres of society. We need to display the righteousness of God in such a way that everyone can see the goodness of God and rejoice, even if you're living in Babylon. Even if you're living in the most adverse, difficult, unfriendly of situations. Even if you're in the land of your enemies with great opposition. You can do good and you can bring transformation. This is God's way to see the kingdom advance.   
**Economic Sphere 43: Peter's Miraculous Catch.**   
I'm gonna be reading from Luke 5:2-7…When \[Jesus\] had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Now go out where it is deeper and let down the net to catch some fish.   
Master\! Simon replied. We worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing. But if you say so, I'll let down the nets one more time. And this time the nets were so full of fish, they began to tear\! A shout for help brought their partners \[to the\] in the other boats, and soon both boats were filled with fish on the verge of sinking.   
You know, obedience to Jesus is the key to windfall success. Just consider for a moment, Peter was a professional fisherman. He grew up in that trade. His father was a fisherman, his brother was a fisherman. His whole family were fishermens. His cousins, his uncles were fishermen. The scriptures,- they had probably a corner on the market of the fishing industry in Northern Galilee. And they were the best. They knew their business inside and out. They knew where the fish were most likely to be caught, at what time of day, what kind of nets to use, what kind of things to lure them into the nets. They knew every detail about the fishing industry. They were professionals. They knew their stuff. They were not casual, summer weekend aficionados, they were pros. But even as pros, they were not being successful. They'd fished all night and they caught nothing.   
And what was key for them was not to rely just on their professionalism, but on intentional listening to the word of Jesus and obedience to that word. When they heard and obeyed Jesus, everything changed. They caught the biggest catch they'd ever caught. It was amazing. It was so many fish that the boat began to sink and they had to call in other boats. And all of the boats were filled to the brim. In just one catch\! It’s extraordinary.   
Friends, in every area of life, success is not measured by our skill or our competence. Those are important things to cultivate. But ultimately success is measured by obedience to God and to his word. And that's not just in your personal lives or your personal affairs, but in your societal responsibilities, in your business roles. And as we do that, we'll see God do extraordinary things in your business and in other businesses that seek to listen and obey God in full detail.   
You know what else I find amazing about this story is Jesus knew how important fishing was to Peter. Jesus wasn't just interested in Peter to call him and so he could become a disciple and preach on his behalf in future times. He knew that Peter loved fishing. And Jesus wanted to bless him. God cares about the work you do. And if we will listen to him, he will speak. If we obey him, he will bless, and \- that will happen even in our vocational professional lives. And Jesus loved doing that, showing Peter, I can make you the best fisherman that you've ever imagined being. And I can also call you to do other things as well. Just keep listening, just keep obeying and that's what we all need to do.   
**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This section is about economics and healthcare. And we talk about healthcare not only in the economic sphere, but also in the family sphere and in the religion sphere and in the government sphere. In each of these four spheres, there are three passages that are related to healthcare. Because the wellbeing, the health of an individual is important to everyone in every sphere. It's important to government, it's important to family, it's important to religion, it's important to business. If people aren't healthy, everything suffers. Not only the individual but all their societal interactions. So healthcare is not the role of just one sphere, but it's the collaborative effort of all the spheres together, coordinating to make sure that everything is done for the wellbeing of the individual. Because the life of the individual is at the heart of the life, the wellbeing of the community. Because without people thriving in health, being well, there is no economics, there is no family, there is no religion, there is no government.   
All the spheres are involved in healthcare because it protects the life. Life is of greatest value. Everyone is involved in preserving, maintaining and enhancing life. That's how it should be. That's not always how it is, but that's God's original design and that's what we want to see. restablished. Healthcare should be a shared concern for all of us, for all these fears and every domain of authority and society.   
**Economic Sphere 44: When Physicians Aren't Enough**   
This passage comes from 2 Chronicles 16:12-13. In the 39th year of his reign, Asa developed a serious foot disease. (Asa was the king of Judah at the time). Yet even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the Lord's help, but turned only to his physicians. So he died in the 41st year of his reign.   
Now the scriptures often speak very positively about physicians. They speak in honoring, respectful ways. Physicians, medical professionals have a vital role in our communities. It is a significant profession involving both science and technology and the business side of caring and showing compassion for people who are ill. But when Asa got sick, he went straight to the physicians and did not seek God. This is where he was wrong. It's not that physicians were wrong, but physicians are health facilitators. God is the healer. Physicians can help give you medications or intervene with different procedures that create an environment for health to be restored. But health is only restored when God acts. And sometimes through the natural means of the design that he's built into the body that have been there from the time of creation or through his supernatural touch in different instances. So we honor the medical profession as health facilitators, but we always, honor God as the healer. We give space for the medical profession, but we never exclude God from the process of healing. So we work with both of those in coordinated way. There's great humility for the professionals in this area who are greatly skilled, who've studied the amazing ways of God's creation and know how to help facilitate that process of restoration of health. But recognizing that ultimately life, its maintenance and its continuity is dependent upon God, who's the giver of life and the one who heals us.   
**Economic Sphere 45: The Cost of Medical Care.**   
So I'm gonna read to you from Mark 5:25-34, not the whole thing, some selections, but it's an encounter that Jesus had with a woman who had been sick for a very long time. We read in Mark's gospel: A woman in the crowd had suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding. She had suffered a great deal \[for\]many doctors, and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she had gotten worse. She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe… Immediately the bleeding stopped… and Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he …asked, who touched my robe?… Then the frightened woman… came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done. And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over.   
Now, this story is told not only in Mark's gospel, but also in Matthew and Luke, almost verbatim. Mark and Matthew are almost identical word for word, but Luke is different. Luke leaves out something very important and what he leaves out is Mark's commentary on doctors. Remember, in Mark it says that she had gone to lots of doctors and spent all her money on the doctors and hadn't got any better. Luke follows the storyline for everything except for that part, which he conveniently leaves out because Luke was a doctor himself. And he didn't want to bad mouth his profession, and throw his colleagues under the bus as it were.   
So this is where it's lovely reading the scriptures. You get to know the authors, you can see their humanity and their personality, and even humor. I imagine Mark and Luke would've known each other and they probably talked about this situation from time to time. You could imagine the teasing that would've gone between them.  
What's important to note is that in the experience of this woman, it had cost her everything she had financially, and she wasn't any better. Sometimes medical costs are too high for the results they produce. And we need to consider that in the economics of medicine, in the business of medicine. Sometimes the charges of seeing the doctor or of buying your prescription drugs from your pharmaceutical companies are exorbitant. And ones like Mark would comment, make a commentary and said, this is not as it should be.   
We must remember that the medical profession must first of all be a profession of compassion and only secondarily a business. It is right for the professionals to make a living, but is not appropriate for that living to be at the expense of the wellbeing of the people they're seeking to serve. The wonderful thing is that Jesus stepped in and healed her at no cost.   
And, this is a transforming act. It not only healed her body, but it improved her bank account. It improved her financial situation. This was amazing. She exercised faith and he released power and she was healed miraculously, instantaneously. Wow, that is so amazing. We must value the medical profession. So grateful for them. But we must remember that God, Jesus \- is the ultimate healer. We need to be careful to set up systems in our various cultures, our various societies, where those who are at greatest need, those who are suffering from disease, are not also suffering from economic hardship because of the cost of medicine. So we must find ways to care for people in both physical and financial ways in their times of need.   
**Economic Sphere 46: The Good Samaritan’s Health Plan.**   
I'm gonna be reading this from Luke 10:30-35. This is the concluding statements of the famous Parable of the Good Samaritan. And remember the one who's writing this, recording this parable is, only recorded by Luke, who's the physician, the doctor. And he finishes the parable with these words from Jesus. …Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him. Going to him, this Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him. The next day, he handed the innkeeper two silver coins, telling him, Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay you the next time I'm here.   
Wow, there's so much to be learned from this parable of the good Samaritan. Not only did a person who would normally be seen as an enemy show transforming compassion, caring compassionate,— involvement. I mean, he cleaned the wounds, he bandaged them, put him on his own animal. But he also displayed incredible generosity. He covered his cost for medical care and for lodging and committed to do even more should that be necessary. This is what we need to take away from this passage. Compassion and generosity are the things that need to drive our healthcare systems.   
What we learned from the Good Samaritan is that he gave all that he had to give and he modeled for us the very nature of what our medical enterprises should look like. He said, if there's more, I'll take care of it. The person who is suffering should not have the pain of financial pressure placed up upon them as well. We need systems that, where individuals and people can contribute and care for one another. We are always to be generous in the healthcare system that we put in place to care for the compassionate needs of others.   
**CROSSOVER INTRODUCTION**  
In this final section of the economic sphere, we're going to look at the crossover passages where economics connects with each of the other six spheres. In each example some of them show how economics in that sphere work together collaboratively in a positive way and at times where they did not work together well and there was destructive consequences. So it's important to realize that no sphere by itself can accomplish all that is needed in society. The religion sphere is not sufficient by itself. The government sphere is not sufficient by itself. And certainly the economic sphere is not sufficient by itself. We all need to do things together with other spheres in order to see the fullness of God's good design for a society fulfilled.   
**Economic Sphere 47: Economics and Family**    
1Kings 5:14. Solomon sent them his laborers to Lebanon in shifts, 10,000 every month, so that each man would be one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of this labor force.   
So when he needed to send people to go to Lebanon to cut trees and bring wood and help in all the building projects he had, he had a couple things that were really key for us in thinking about how he was thoughtful about family, while he was trying to advance a business proposal.   
First thing. And it's important to remember that Solomon is known for his wisdom, one of the wisest, if not the wisest man who ever lived. He had that they would never have gone for more than a month at a time. So he had 30,000 people that they hired and every only 10,000 were employed at a time. 20,000 were at home. And so, they would be gone for a month and come home for two months, gone for a month and come home for two months, never longer than a month. And that's really important.  
If your business requires you to go on a trip that's longer than a month, 6, 8, 10 or more weeks, family will begin to suffer. It will be too hard for everyone. And at that point, all kinds of difficulties and temptations set in. So they were never gone from the family more than one month at a time. Now that increased the costs. If they were gone a month away or or two months gone, and then two months home, two months gone, two months home, they could have been less cost because there would be less travel that Solomon would've had to pay to incur his business venture. But he realized that part of- he needed to do business in such a way that would be healthy for families, because if families suffer, the business will ultimately suffer as well. They need to collaborate and think together. So first rule was not more than a month away at a time.   
The second rule is not more than a third of the time in a year away. So the idea wasn't, they were gone a month and then home for just two weeks and then gone another month. They'd be gone a month and come back for two months. So two thirds of their time was at home. And so it may be that on some occasion you would have a shorter time at home. But over a years program, you should be two thirds of your time with your family. Especially when your children are young and growing, developing. They need mom or they need dad at home. They need both of them there the majority of the time. This is very important. So your business should never crowd out family responsibilities, but business patterns, business rhythms should be designed in such a way as to enhance and facilitate family health and strength and continuity. That's wise, that's what Solomon thinks. I don't think you can do any better than that.  
**Economic Sphere 48: Economics and Government**  
The crossover passage between Economics and Government   We’re going to read selections from 1Kings 21:1-19. Just a few selections from this longer passage. Now, there was a man named Naboth, from Jezreel, who owned a vineyard in Jezreel beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. One day Ahab said to Naboth… I would like to buy it… but Naboth replied, the Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance that was passed down by my ancestors.   
So Ahab went home angry and sullen because of Naboth's answer… What's the matter? His wife Jezebel asked him… I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or to trade it, but he refused\! Ahab told her.   
Are you the king of Israel or not? Jezebel to demand. I'll get you Naboth’s vineyard. So she wrote letters in Ahab's name …to the elders of the town …where Naboth lived. In her letter, she commanded… stone him to death.   
So he… was stoned to death. The town leaders then sent word to Jezebel. Naboth has been stoned to death. When Jezebel heard the news, she said to Ahab, you know the vineyard Naboth wouldn't sell you? Well, you can have it now\! He's dead\! So Ahab immediately went down to the vineyard of Naboth to claim it.   
Wow. Everything in this story, everything about it is wrong. Ahab and Jezebel use governmental position, governmental power, authority, to advance personal economic prospects. That is wrong. That is not why they have been given the role of rulership.   
It's a story of corruption. Whenever we collude with economics in some inappropriate way with any other sphere, in this case it's government, it could also be with education or religion or media \- when there's this collusion that between the spheres \-to use the position of power to enrich yourself, to benefit yourself, to enhance your prospects in an individual manner? That is criminal. It is wrong, it should never be allowed. So let's learn from this. The warning is a very sad tale —when people use their power in one sphere to take advantage in another sphere. Let's learn how to respect the domain of each sphere and live within the legal and appropriate parameters that is given to each one of us.   
**Economic Sphere 49: Economics and Religion.**   
This is taken from 2 Kings 5:20-27. We've made a brief mention of this in an earlier passage is good to read this whole thing again. But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said to himself, My master should not have let this Aramean get away without accepting of his gifts… So Gehazi set off after Namaan… Gehazi said, my master sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the hill country of Ephraim have just arrived. He would like 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing to give to them. 

(The course was a lie.). Namaan responds “By all means, take twice as much silver, Namaan insisted… Gehazi took the gifts… then he went and hid the gifts inside the house. When he went into   his master, Elijah asked him, where have you been Gehazi?… Is this the time to receive money and clothing…? Because you have done this, you and your descendants will suffer from Namaan's leprosy forever. When Gehazi left the room, he was covered with leprosy. His skin was quite as snow. 

Just like you should not use governmental power, as we looked in the last passage, to advance a personal financial benefit, so also religion should never be viewed as a profit making enterprise. We do not do the things of God in order to get wealthy or to benefit personally. 

**Economic Sphere 50: Economics and Education.**   
Galatians 6:6. Those who are taught the Word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them. 

So in the previous passage, number 49, we looked at \- you should not profit from religious activity. And yet at the same time, a religious worker is worthy of his wages. If he teaches — is a good teacher, gives an educational benefit, then certainly it's worthy to recompense them financially, not exorbitantly, but appropriately. We read about this in Luke 10:7, and 1 Timothy 5:18. 

**Economic Sphere 51: Economics and Media Communication.**   
We're gonna read from Leviticus 6:1-5. Then the Lord said to Moses, Suppose one of you sins against your associate and is unfaithful to the Lord. Suppose you cheat in a deal involve a security deposit, or you steal or commit fraud, or you find lost property and lie about it, or you lie about swearing to tell the truth, or you commit any other such sin. If you have sinned in any of these ways, you are guilty. You must give back whatever you stole, or the money you took in extortion, or the security deposit, or the lost property you found, or anything obtained by swearing falsely… 

Unjust communication cannot be a foundation for economic advance. If you committed fraud, that means you've portrayed yourself in a way that is not true. It's dishonest, it's an act of lie. Or if you lie about it. Or lie about swearing to tell the truth \- I will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth —and you're intent on lying. Then any gain financially that you have through those lies, you need to make right. Anything obtained by swearing falsely is not rightfully yours. It's economic defrauding, and you need to make it right.

**Economic Sphere 52: Economics and Celebration.**   
We're going to look at some verses out of Leviticus 23\.

You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly, all the people must stop their ordinary work and observe an official day for holy assembly. The people must again stop all their ordinary work to observe an official date for holy assembly. That same day will be proclaimed an official date for holy assembly, a day which you do no ordinary work. You must do no ordinary work on that day. You must proclaim an official day for holy assembly when you do no ordinary work. Another holy day, no ordinary work must be done that day. 

You can see, I've just taken out these phrases that occur throughout these chapters, and it lists seven different festivals, feasts that were supposed to be honored in the Jewish calendar. 

Three of the seven festivals were called pilgrimage festivals, which require the people to travel to Jerusalem where the Temple was. Each of those festivals were a week long celebration. It was a wonderful gathering, seeing friends and family from upcountry all around the place we would gather at the same time. Great reunions. Lots of joy, times of worship, times of eating times of friendship, times of reflection on the ways of God. 

But it, it not only took those seven days, but the days traveling there, maybe one or two or three days going to Jerusalem one or two or three days returning home. And so very quickly, you can see that all these festivals quickly came to represent 10% or more of the potential workdays in a year. And that was a big chunk. 

And God is saying It's important to stop working, come together and celebrate. Because the purpose is to build community, to know that you belong, to be able to have a common identity to refresh together the story of God, what he's done in your midst, where you came from, how he brought you out of Egypt, what he has done and how he has redeemed you. And this story, and what holds you together is so important. You need, need to stop some other things that are really important. You need to stop work. That is really vital in order to have these rhythms of celebration. 

Something to think about. Do we try to minimize the holiday time, the vacation time? How do we, how do we build that time where it's not just time off work, but time that really builds community. These are thoughts for us to consider, as we seek to implement the spheres in our generations and our culture and as society in a way that advances the kingdom of God. 



**Government Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader

**Introduction to the Government Sphere**

So we are now looking at the sphere of government. God has appointed government in order to safeguard justice and create a peaceful society. Rulers should exercise delegated authority in order to serve the citizens whom they govern. The Law of the Kings found in Deuteronomy 17:14-21 warns those in authority against multiplying that which would lead them into lifestyle of authoritarianism, hedonism and materialism. God's alternative to these three unrighteous value systems is servanthood, purity, and generosity. We must seek to end every form of injustice, corruption, and greed, and establish godly government. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
As with each of the spheres, we begin by looking at God and his character in relationship to that sphere. So we're gonna look at six passages about God and the sphere of government.

**Government Sphere 1: God our Judge, Lawgiver and King.**   
This comes from Isaiah 33:22:  for the Lord is our judge, our lawgiver and our king. He will care for us and save us. 

This is amazing passage. Reflecting on this passage during the time of the Reformation in Europe, 500 some years ago, these three divine functions led to the formation of governmental structures that resulted in the three separate branches of government, the judicial, the legislative and executive, they model their government based upon what the scriptures reveal about who God is. That's a really good design.

**Government Sphere 2: Mercy and Justice.**   
from Jeremiah 7:5-7. but I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds, to start treating each other with justice. Only if you stop exploiting foreigners, orphans, and widows, only if you stop your murdering and only if you stop harming yourself by worshiping idols, then I will let you stay in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.

Only if, only if, only if, only if …four times…forever. So this is a conditional forever. God always wants to give longevity and permanence, but there are things that we have to do. In this passage the words justice and mercy are both mentioned. Both of them, justice and mercy, are attributes of love. Love is a choice that always seeks the highest wellbeing of the one loved. Therefore a truly loving person will always be just. Injustice has no place in the life of a loving person. 

Similarly, a truly loving person will seek every opportunity to be merciful. A lack of mercy reveals a lack of love. Now because God is love, as we read in 1John 4:8, God is perfectly just and exceedingly merciful in all that he does. Yet here we have a dilemma, for though justice and mercy are each an expression of love, each exhibits a different aspect of love. On the one hand, justice upholds righteousness and equity and thus demand that the penalty of a crime be paid. On the other hand, mercy champions compassion and grace, and thus pleads that the penalty of the crime be waived. So what happens to a convicted criminal? If he is sent to jail to pay for his crime, justice is upheld. If he is set free so that he need not pay for his crime, then mercy has been extended. But he can't at one and the same time be both sent to jail and not sent to jail. Here is the challenge. How can we be just without being unmerciful? Or how can we be merciful without causing injustice? How do we demonstrate both justice and mercy towards others? Or we could ask it this way. If we seek to be people of love, when is it desirable to exercise justice, and when is it appropriate to show mercy? 

The interplay of justice and mercy is one of the overarching themes of the scriptures. Understanding this interplay is essential for good governance. When we look at God and see how he chooses this \- mercy and justice at any given situation \- we learn how governments should function. Only God does this perfectly, but we can learn from him through observing and imitating. God is always just. He’ll never be less than just, but he always prefers to extend mercy whenever he can do so justly. These are things to think about and study for our government and actually for all of our personal lives as well. 

**Government Sphere 3: God Gives a Unique Law.**   
Psalm 147:19-20. He has revealed his word to Jacob, his decrees and regulations to Israel. He has not done this for any other nation. They do not know his regulations. Praise the Lord. 

Praise the Lord? Is that really the right response that only Israel has this regulation or no other nation knows the God's law and the way that Israel does? Shouldn't we want everyone to have the same? What's going on here? See, only God's law, the law of God's kingdom, convicts people for heart attitudes. God's law perfectly addresses the root problem of all lawlessness. No human government is able to do this with such precision. 

When we go back to the 10 commandments. They're not just a potpourri of dos and don’ts. They’re an intentional instruction going from the most concrete to the most abstract; from the most external to the most internal. You'll look at this when we consider the key passages of the foundations that are true for all of our spheres. But suffice it to say this, that the first nine laws in some form or another are present in almost every society. You shall not murder, laws on adultery, laws on thievery,  laws on falsehood, lying and various falsehoods. Those exist in some form or other in almost every culture. 

But the last law is thou shall not covet. No nation has that on the books. You're not gonna go to jail because you had a thought about that person's wife is really gorgeous, so I would like to have her, or my\! That person's television is really sweet. I'd like to have one like that for myself- That coveting doesn't put you in jail, it doesn't give you a fine, doesn't leave you a death penalty in any other nation. Not in Switzerland, not in Germany, not in South Africa, not in South Korea, not in Canada, not in Mexico. Nowhere. But in the kingdom of God, it reveals the corrupt heart and it needs to be changed. 

So God's law is a higher standard. It changes us from the inside out. That's why this law is unique. That's why it is foundational to all other laws, because until you've changed the heart, you really can't expect changed actions. 

**Government Sphere 4: God is the Unique Lawgiver.**   
James 4:12. God alone gave the law as the judge, he alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge a neighbor? 

Normally the judicial and legislative branches are separate, but the triune God embodies both of these, plus the kingly executive roles in his one person. He's a unique lawgiver. He's a law giver who can execute the law, and judge when those who have broken the law. He is unique and wonderfully so, to our benefit. 

**Government Sphere 5: The Foundations of God's Throne.**   
Psalm 89:14,18.  Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne… Unfailing love and truth walk before you as attendants. Yes, our protection comes from the Lord and he, the holy one of Israel has given us our king.

Righteousness, justice, love, truth, protection. These are the elements. These are the characteristics of a godly government. And God is the one who gives kings. God wants us to have this sphere, but he wants it to be done in a way that is in keeping with his character. 

**Government Sphere 6: King Messiah.**   
Isaiah 9:6-7. For a child is born to us. A son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders and he'll be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace. 

As I read those, you could may be be hearing this, the music of the Handel’s Messiah, ringing in your ears. Beautiful, beautiful words. 

His government and its peace will never end. He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity. The passionate commitment to the Lord of Heaven's armies will make sure that this happens. 

What a wonderful ruler. He's a wonderful counselor. He, when you need advice, he's the best one. He’s a Mighty God. There's never any shortage of power. He can do what you need to having done. He's the Everlasting Father. You always have that covering, loving relationship. And he's the Prince of Peace, he brings wars to end and ministers to the deepest areas of your soul. What a wonderful ruler. 

But what a wonderful kingdom, it is forever. It does not end. And it's only increasing. And it says the passionate commitment or the zeal of the Lord will accomplish this. He is doing this. We can help. We can participate. But ultimately it is God our King, who is reigning. And his reign is increasing on this earth, all the time. Governments of this world should look to the government of our God and seek to be imitators, to do that which God is doing. Then their governments too, will increase as they seek to model themselves after God. 

So, as the governors of this world, those who carry civic responsibilities in cities and states and provinces and over nations or over international, governance groupings. We need to look to God to see how he governs and seek to imitate him. If you govern as he governs, then it'll be to the benefit of all. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
The primary purpose of government is to protect and safeguard justice. And so we're gonna look at eight passages that highlight that from the scriptures. 

**Government Sphere 7: The Purpose Of Government Is To Protect.**   
We read from Romans 13:1-7. Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted and they will be punished. For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right. And they will honor you. The authorities are God's servants sent for your good, but if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid or they have the power to punish you. They are God's servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong. So you must submit to them not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience. Pay your taxes too, for these same reasons for government workers need to be paid. There are serving God in what they do. Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them and give respect, and honor to those who are in authority. 

God's design for government is that they honor those who do what is right and punish those who do what is wrong. They have been empowered with an authority to maintain justice and protect the citizenship from those who would do them ill. From criminals within their nation or from armies coming from without \- invading. They're there to protect. Therefore, government should be given respect, honor, and even taxes. I know that's hard for some people, but that's the Bible. We’re to see them as God's servants when they are maintaining societal order honoring the right and punishing the wrong. Government is there by God's design. So we should honor it and see people released into this area as civil servants to advance God's good purposes. 

**Government Sphere 8: The Daughters of Zelophehad.**   
Wow, that name is a mouthful, and you'll read about them in Government Spheres 27:1-11.  It’s longer passage, but pay attention is a lot of interesting material here. 

One day a petition was presented by the daughters of Zelophedhad \- Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. Their father, Zelophedhad, was a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph. These women stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the tribal leaders and the entire community at the entrance of the tabernacle. Our father died in the wilderness, they said. He was not among Korah’s followers who rebelled against the Lord. He died because of his own sin. He had no sons. Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan just because he had no sons? Give us property along with the rest of our relatives. 

So Moses brought their case before the Lord, and the Lord replied to Moses. The claim of the daughters as Zelophedhad had is legitimate. You must give them a grant of land along with their father's relatives, assign him the property that would've been given to their father and give the following instructions to the people of Israel. If a man dies and has no son, then give his inheritance to his daughters. And if he has no daughter either, transfer his inheritance to his brothers, if he has no brothers give his inheritance to his father's brothers. But if his father has no brothers give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan. This is a legal requirement for the people of Israel, just as the Lord commanded Moses. 

This is a wonderful example of casebook… law. They look at a particular case of circumstances, situation, and try to understand the overarching principle and how it applies in this unique situation. This is where the spirit of the law is debated, and we see how it might be applied in diverse circumstances. It's an enlightening example for legislation and jurisprudence and has been helpful for the formation of legal processes through the generations. 

To understand what's going on here, there are several different steps. First, there was the standard law. This law was not prescribed by God, per se, but it was the normative accepted process within the culture. In the ancient culture of the Hebrews, property was inherited by the sons in the family. Two portions went to the first born and one portion to each of the remaining sons. So there were four sons and two daughters. The first son would get 40%. The other three sons would each get 20% and the daughters would get 0%. That was the norm. This was the culture. And it is reflected in Proverbs 19:14. Fathers can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth. This norm goes all the way back to the story of Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 21:10, where he's says that he's gonna pass on his inheritance to his son.

Now. And we come to the daughters of Zelophedhad. This is point two, and the law needed to be adjusted because of this situation, there were no sons to be had, he had only five daughters. What would happen to the inheritance? The law was modified to keep the family patrimony intact. You needed to guard the inheritance for future generations. So that's was a remarkable how they worked at having the flexibility, keeping the principle, but adjusting it for their circumstance. 

But we read a little bit later on in Government Spheres 36:1-12, that the law is readjusted again, because the clan leaders of Joseph’s clan, the tribe \- because if the daughters of Zelophedhad marry outside of our clan, outside of our tribe, then that property will go to that family, that's no longer part of our tribe. So the land is theirs, but it's also ours. It's not just the nuclear family, but the clan family, the larger family. And so can we make that, require that if they get married, they have to marry within the tribe? And they all thought about it. Yes. They're trying to preserve the inheritance for the small family, for the large family. And that seemed to make sense. We didn't want the larger families to suffer. We didn't want the small family to suffer. So that way in verse 12, it concludes the inheritance of land remained within their ancestral tribe. They kept the principle and found creative ways to bring application. Great for us as we think about laws today.

**Government Sphere 9: For Such a Time as This.**   
We're reading from Esther 4:13-16. Mordicai sent this reply to Esther. Don't think for a moment that because you are in the palace, you'll escape it when all other Jews are killed. If you keep quiet at a time like this deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this? Then Esther sent this reply to Mordicai, go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then though it is against the law, I will go into see the king. If I must die, I must die. 

Esther was the queen. This was an important governmental role. She needed to act in a way that is righteous even if it put her at risk of suffering. She had to risk her life to eliminate the great injustice, the suffering that was proposed for her people. And we need to follow this principle today. The role of a government leader is to serve those that he or she is leading. And you might have to risk your influence, your position, even your life. That's why you are there, to advocate for justice, to be a voice for the voiceless no matter the cost. 

We also learned from this that prayer and fasting are an integral part of advancing governmental justice. We don't only rely on human processes, put on divine methodologies. 

Now, Esther was willing to break a law, the law was that no one would go in to see the king without being summoned. If you went in of your own accord, it was very presumptive, very prideful. And so the king could command you to be killed. But she took that risk and was willing to bear the personal consequences in order to uphold a greater law. The law love of justice, of equity. So she risked herself in order to serve her people. 

**Government Sphere 10: Paul Protected by Rome.**  
Now this next passage, **number 10\.** Paul protected by Rome. It comes from Acts 23:12-35. It's rather long passage. So I will just summarize some of it. It's when Paul was arrested in Jerusalem, there was a group of Jews who got together and bound themselves with an oath, not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. So there was this plot to murder him on the way to his trial and his nephew, Paul's nephew, found out about this and went and told Paul and Paul said, please tell the commander. And so he has, because he has something important to tell him. So he went to the commander and Paul's nephew told him some Jews are going to ask you to bring Paul before the eye council tomorrow, pretending they want to get some more information, but don't do it. There are more than 40 men hiding along the way, ready to ambush him. They have vowed not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him. They're ready now just waiting for your consent. 

So there's a lot of drama and intrigued behind the scenes, things going on in the political realm there, it's just a very, you know, high drama story. And the Roman commander pays attention to Paul's nephew. And immediately that night sends Paul out of the city with 200 soldiers guarding him and avoids this calamity. And he writes a letter to the governor, Felix, telling him why he's sending him as a prisoner, that he's protected him from this plot on his life. 

So that night as ordered, the soldiers took Paul, as far as Antipatris, they returned to the fortress the next morning, while the mountain truth took him onto Caesarea. When they arrived at Caesarea, they presented Paul and the letter to the governor Felix. He read it and asked Paul what province he was from. “Cilicia,” Paul answered. He says, I will hear your case myself when you're accusers arrived. The governor told him. Here's a very interesting story worth reading it in his entirety, but here the key thing is that numerous times in Paul's life, the Roman authorities came to Paul's defense. Paul himself was a Roman citizen, but let's just consider some of these episodes. 

On Paul's first missionary journey in Acts 13, he's in Cyprus has turned as Sergius Paulus, the governor of Cyprus believes in the gospel and takes a stand for him against those who would be opposing him. On his second journey, in Acts 16, Paul finds himself in the city of Philippi and the city officials urged the jailer “to let these men go” as soon as they discovered that he had been unlawfully jailed. Later on in that same journey in Acts 18 Paul's in Corinth and Gallio, who's the newly appointed governor of Akea, which would be the equivalent of Greece today, throws out of the court, the foundless accusations of the Jewish religious leaders who wanted to get Paul executed in Corinth. On the third journey in Acts 19, the mayor of Ephesus disperses the riotous crowd, and protects Paul from a lynching by a mob. 

And so time and time again, we see the government coming to his defense. 

You know, many see the book of Acts written has legal brief written to aid Paul's defense before Nero to whom he had appealed when wrongfully arrested in Jerusalem. Paul declares his innocence in Acts 25:11, and an assessment is confirmed by both governor Festus and King Herod Agrippa in Acts 26:31. After hearing Paul's testimony, they assert this man hasn't done anything to deserve death or imprisonment. You can imagine how this story with all these governors and authorities previously having attested to his innocence, how this would've helped his case before Nero. Actually the only government official that colluded with rioters in an attempt to kill Paul was King Aretas of the \_\_\_\_\_ and the \_\_\_\_ were the arch enemies of the Romans. You can read about this in Acts 9:25 and 2 Corinthians 11:32-33. The fact that Aretas wanted to have Paul killed and all his governors were on his side, would’ve further bolstered Paul's case in the Roman court of law as he faced Nero. 

**Government Sphere 11: Children Not Protected By Herod.**    
Matthew 2:16-18. Herod is furious when he realized that the Wiseman had outwitted him, he sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who are two years old and under, based on the Wiseman's report of the star’s first appearance, Herod's brutal action fulfilled what God has spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, a cry was heard in Ramah. Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeps for children refusing to be comforted for they are dead. 

This passage speaks of Herod's brutal action. This is not what one should expect from a government leader. Government is supposed to protect the vulnerable in society. The fact that Herod The Great murdered the most innocent ones, not only here, but in other episodes that are not recorded in the Bible, but are just in history, marked him as one of the cruelest and most corrupt leaders of antiquity. He was despised by his people and rightfully so. He murdered so many of his sons that Caesar declared “It is safer to be a dog in Herod’s house than to be one of his sons.” His life is an example of how one should not govern. 

**Government Sphere 12: Vigilante-ism Undermines Justice.**   
Exodus 2:11-15, Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit. He saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews. After looking in all directions, he made sure no one was watching. Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand. The next day, when Moses went out to visit his people again, he saw up two Hebrew men fighting. Why are you beating up your friend? Moses said to the one who had started the fight. The man replied, who appointed you to be our prince and judge, are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday? Then Moses was afraid, thinking Everyone knows what I did and sure enough, Pharaoh heard what had happened. And he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian… 

Injustice is never solved by taking the law into your own hands. Private attempts to exercise judicial solutions on others, only multiplies injustice. 

Moses may well have wanted to right a wrong. His motive might have been laudable, but his means made him culpable. He was not a liberator. He was a murderer. 

See, we have to learn in every sphere to do God's will, God's way. The established protocols of judicial justice in a healthy society are vitally important. Both the end and the means must be just if justice is to be genuinely served. If shortcuts are taken in the ‘how’ of executing justice, the ‘what’ of justice suffers and injustice is exacerbated. The problems only increase. 

**Government Sphere 13: Anarchy Undermines Justice.**   
Judges 21:25 says in those days, Israel had no king. All the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes. 

This is the sad conclusion of a book filled with horrible tales of injustice and evil and human beings doing cruel things to other human beings. Having no government is not a biblical solution to resolving problems caused by a corrupt government because the root problem lies in the hearts or lives of individual men and women. An appropriate government is a deterrent against lawlessness. That's what we saw in Romans 13. You'll see a parallel passage in a complimentary thought in the next key passage, number 14\. 

**Government Sphere 14: Bureaucracy Undermines Justice.**   
Eccelsiastes 5:8-9. Don't be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful. And if justice is being miscarried throughout the land. For every official is under orders from higher up and matters of justice gets lost in red tape and bureaucracy, even the king milks the land for his own profit, 

Just as we saw in the previous key passage Government Sphere 13, that no government is not a biblical solution \- more government is not a biblical solution to resolving problems caused by a corrupt government. Because again, the root problem lies on the hearts and lives of individual men and women. More individuals working in the public sector increases more potential for corruption. 

Here we have between these two passages, the Goldilocks principle. Remember the childhood story of Goldilocks with the three bears? She comes into that house when the bears are gone and she eats Papa bear’s porridge \- it’s too cold and Mama's bear’s porridge is too hot. And Baby Bear’s porridge is just right. Then she sits on one chair, Papa bear’s chair is too high. And Mama Bear’s chair is too low. And Baby Bear’s chair is just right and everything is like these two extremes and, and is just right, is that middle point. 

The Goldilocks principle is this. It's not no government and it's not excessive government; it is just right government, just the right size. The biblical concept is called subsidiarity. This word, which is not often used by us, means to have as little as possible, but as much as necessary. Exodus 18, when Jethro talks with Moses about how to set up the legal system, models this \- solving an issue at the lowest most local level possible. And if it can't be solved, then you need to get up to the next level. And the next level. Subsidiarity \- just the right amount of government. Goldilocks, thank you. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
Our next section is entitled Principles and Practices of Godly Government. We're gonna look at eight passages and you'll see how very practical, how very real the Bible is to give guidance for this and every sphere of society. 

**Government Sphere 15: Righteous Leadership Is A Blessing.**   
from 2 Samuel 23:3-4. We read: the God of Israel spoke. The rock of Israel said to me, the one who rules righteously, who rules in the fear of God is like the light of morning that sunrise, like the morning without clouds, like the gleaning of the sun on new grass after rain. Yeah. 

Government can be a good thing. When we do it right, when we do it well, when we do it righteously, government is a blessing, just like those beautiful morning that is described in this passage. It says to rule in the fear of the Lord. As we looked already, several times, Proverbs 8:13 says the fear of the Lord is defined as the hatred of evil, as the beginning of all wisdom. When we hate evil in government roles and don't bow to corruption and, and serve well, this is desirable for all, like a sunny new day. 

**Government Sphere 16: Josiah: A King who did Good In The Eyes Of The Lord.**   
2 King's 22:2 Josiah did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight and followed the example of his ancestor, David, he did not turn away from doing what was right. 

Some people think that politics is dirty business, but it doesn't have to be so. What Josiah did was pleasing in God's sight. And so it should be in our sight as well. So if you can be in government and please God, let's learn how to do that. 

Josiah was not the only king in the book of 2 Kings that is said to have been pleasing in the Lord's sight. We can read also about Joash in chapter 12, Amaziah in chapter 14, Uzziah and Jotham both in chapter 15 and Hezekiah chapter 18. The acts of righteous government leaders were pleasing in to God's eyes. This phrase is similar, though it's a different word in Hebrew, but a synonymous to the righteous acts of a priest offering a sacrifice to God, which was pleasing to his nose, was a pleasing aroma. So pleasing sight and a pleasing aroma appealing to the various senses of how we perceive reality. That passage of the priest and the sacrifices is mentioned 18 times in the book of Government Spheres alone. And when we look at that, we realize there is no sacred \- secular dichotomy. If what the priest does can be pleasing to God's nose and a king can do what pleasing to God's eyes, then let us each pursue God's call on our lives uniquely and seek to be pleasing to him. 

**Government Sphere 17: Deborah: a Woman in National Leadership.**   
This is from the book of Judges 4 selections from between verse four and 16\. Deborah was the wife of Lappidoth. She was a prophet who was judging Israel at the time. She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel, in the hill country of Ephriam and the Israelites would go to her for judgment. So this was her judicial role. One day she sent for Barak, son of a Abinoam, who lived in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, this is what the Lord that God of Israel commands you. Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of death only and Selin at Mount Tabor. And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and warriors to the Kishon river. There I will give you victory over him. 

So she gives him directions. She's acting as a Commander in Chief, and he says, I will go, but only if you go with me, she says very well, but today you will win a victory, but a woman will get the honor. And so she went with Barak and he is able to have an unexpected, unusual victory. And not a single one of Sisera’s warriors were left alive. 

It's a powerful story about a powerful woman who served alongside men to advance God's purposes in her generation. Government is a domain in which both men and women can exercise their gifts. Like all the spheres, they're all open to every single person to use the gifts that God has placed in them to advance good for society. 

**Government Sphere 18: Nehemiah’s Leadership Integrity.**   
Nehemiah 5:14-18. For the entire 12 years that I was governor of Judah from the 20th year to the 32nd year of the reign of king Artezerxes, neither I nor my officials drew on our official food allowance. The former governors in contrast had laid heavy burdens on the people, demanding a daily ration of food and wine besides 40 pieces of silver, even their assistants took advantage of the people. But because I feared God, I did not act that way. I also devoted myself to working on the wall and refuse to acquire any land. I required all my servants to spend time working on the wall. I asked for nothing, even though I regularly fed 150 Jewish officials at my table, besides all the visitors from other lands, the provisions I paid for each day included one ox, six choice sheep, or goats, and a large number of poultry. And every 10 days we needed a large supply of all kinds of wine. Yet I refused to claim that governor's food allowance because the people already carried a heavy burden. 

This is a wonderful testimony of an incredibly great leader. It is often said that politicians promised to do good for the people, but they end up doing good for themselves. Making good for themselves. This needs not be so. Nehemiah is a stellar example, he did not profit financially from his position. He did not do so illegally through means of corruption or even legally using the funds that were offered him. This was an example of true servanthood. He did the same work as people, when they were building the wall, he joined them in that work, he didn't stand it at distance. He was engaged with the people in every way. He did not require things of others that he was not willing to do himself. And he did not expand his real estate holdings. He didn't retire from government and now had a plush lifestyle because of all the benefits and trappings he gained. He lived a simple life as the governor and he identified with the people, truly serving them. Why? He was concerned that people already carried a heavy burden. He didn't want to increase the taxes or take more from them. And so that \- what a great example that is for government leaders today.

 

**Government Sphere 19: Joseph Enslaves Egypt.**   
In our previous example, we looked at the stellar example of Nehemiah. We're gonna look at a tragic example in this one. We're reading from Genesis 47:13-26. This it's a long passage, but it's worth reading carefully. It's often skipped over, but listen well.  Meanwhile, the famine became so severe that all the food was used up and people were starving throughout the lands of Egypt and Canaan. By selling grain to the people. Joseph eventually collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan, and he put the money in Pharaoh's treasury. When the people of Egypt and Canaan ran out of money, all the Egyptians came to Joseph. Our money is gone. They cried, but please give us food. Or we will die before your very eyes. Joseph replied since your money is gone. Bring me your livestock. I will give you food and exchange for your livestock. 

So they brought their livestock to Joseph in exchange for food, in exchange for their horses, flock and sheep and goats, herds of cattle and donkeys, Joseph provided them with food for another year, but that year ended. And the next year they came again and said, we cannot hide the truth from you. My Lord, our money is gone and all of our livestock and cattle are yours. We have nothing left to give to you, but our bodies and our land. Why should we die before your very eyes. Buy us in our land in exchange for food, we offer our land and ourselves as slaves for Pharaoh, just give us grain so we need live and not die. So the land does not become empty and desolate. So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. All the Egyptians sold him their fields because the famine was so severe and, and soon all the land belonged to Pharaoh. 

As for the people, he made them all slaves from one end Egypt to the other. The only land he did not buy was the land belonging to the priests who received an allotment of food directly from Pharaoh. So they didn't need to sell their land. 

Then Joseph said to the people, Look today, I bought your you and your land for Pharoah. I will provide you with seeds so you can plant your fields. And when you harvest, one fifth year, crop will belong to Pharaoh. You may keep the remaining four fifth of seed for your fields and as food for you, your household and your little ones. You save our lives. They explain may please my Lord to let us be Pharoah’s servants. Joseph then issued a decree still in effect of the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh  to receive one fifth of all the crops grown in the land. Only the land belonging to the priests was not given to Pharaoh. 

Now, I grew up in South America. I lived in Bolivia during my childhood and adolescent years, and during those 17 years of life, there were more presidents than there were years. There were lots of coups and, and military dictatorships. And, and you know, when there's a dictator, you always say nice things to the dictator, because if you don’t, you're dead. So when they said you saved our lives, yes, there were still breathing. But that was the only good thing left. 

What had happened. He took all their money. Then he took all of their animals. That was the means of production, if you would. It was, they gave them animals for food. That was the original stock exchange. And without those animals, you can't, you know, have kids or cows or calves and, and you can't multiply your wealth. And then they took the land, which is the real estate. And by this time everything was going to Pharaoh. 

Now God had saved Joseph in a miraculous way. But the one who's benefiting from this is centralizing all the wealth and all the power in Pharaohs. And he's nationalized all the land. This is a communist policy. This is total socialism at its very worst. And then, they all become slaves. Would you vote for a man who, if you knew that in three, four years time, he would take away all of your civil liberties? See long before the Egyptians enslaved the Hebrews, a Hebrew enslaved all the Egyptians. It says from one end of Egypt to the other. 

Now we, this story might be shocking to you, because we usually don't read about this passage in our Sunday school classes. 

The only ones that were not enslaved were the priests and these were idolatrous priests. And why did he spare them? Well, he had married the daughter of one of the chief priests. So this was corrupt cronyism, nepotism. This was not a godly form of leadership. 

Now, there are a lot of things about Joseph’s life that were praiseworthy. He did not commit adultery with Potipher’s wife. He had a financial integrity when he was the steward in the jail where he was kept. He was willing to forgive his brothers who had mistreated him. He didn't harbor resentment or bitterness against them. Although those are virtuous examples, but they are about his personal life. But when he stepped into his governmental role, he loved the power and he controlled. He centralized everything. No one could buy food without his say \-so. He was number two. This was his dream from childhood. And this love of authority, this authoritarianism, is the opposite of governmental servanthood. And it grieves God. 

From the moment that Joseph enters into that role as number two in the kingdom, the scriptures do not ever record him talking to God or God talking to him again. It just goes silent. He's pursuing the way of the world. This is not the way we're intended to govern. Think of ways that he could have done. Might he created local co-ops, different ways to diversify the crops. There could have been so many other strategies, had he pressed in and listened to God a little bit more and not wanted to centralize power. We need to re-look at Joseph \- imitate him in his personal life, but avoid imitating him in his social life, in his vocational life as a government leader.

**Government Sphere 20: Pray For Those in Authority.**   
taken from 1 Timothy 2:2. pray this way for Kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. 

This is really important. Governing is a hard job. There are lots of pressures. There are lots of temptations. There are lots of ways in which things could go wrong, and we need to stand with those in authority, through prayer, asking God to intervene, to guide them, to help them. 

This peaceful and quiet? That's a really good societal goal. We love it when there's peace in our society. When there's streets are quiet, when there are not disturbances and riots. And you know, he's, he writes this in times when there's persecution, when there are difficulties going on. And so the choices that government leaders make are really important to the wellbeing of people. So pray, pray like to your life depends on it, because it just might.

**Government Sphere 21: Fear God And Honor the King.**   
This is taken from 1 Peter 2:13-17. for the Lord's sake, submit to all human authority, whether the king is head of state or the officials he has appointed. For the king has sent them to punish those who do wrong. And to honor those who do right. It is God's will that your honorable life shall silence those ignorant people who make foolish accusations against you, for you are free yet you are God's slave. So don't use your freedom as an excuse to do evil. Respect everyone. Love the family of believers, fear God and respect the king. 

We must always respond correctly with the right attitudes to everyone who's engaged in the various spheres of society. The religious sphere does not obliterate the governmental sphere or vice versa. The governmental sphere does not wipe out the religious sphere. We recognize the role. You fear God, you respect the king. There's a, these things go hand in hand and we need to appreciate and value the role of government. 

One of the things that's noteworthy here, it says “you are free”. And while talking about government, while talking about submitting to those in authority, it speaks about our freedom. We have an essential intrinsic freedom, but we're free to be slaves of God, in other words, we’re free to do those things which are determined by his will. Those things which are good, good for our neighbor, good for our society, good for our families, good for our lives. And we're not free to do evil. We're free to do good. And when we walk in that freedom, then the great things happen in our society. 

**Government Sphere 22: Biblical Civil Disobedience \#1**  
this is the first of three passages about Biblical Civil Disobedience . All three passages come from the book of Daniel. Daniel served at the highest levels of government. And so he writes about these things with great personal authority. This first example comes from Daniel 3:1-30 as the whole chapter is too long to read entirety, so it means a few highlights. 

King Nebecanezzer made a gold statue, 90 feet tall and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. Then he sent messengers to the high officers, officials, governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up. Everyone in government was present. Okay? So all these officials came and stood before the statue king Nebuchadnezzar had set up, then a herald shouted out people of all race, nations, and languages listened to the King's command. When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and other musical instruments, bow to the ground to worship king Nebuchadnezzar’s gold statue. Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. 

Now present that day were, we don't read of Daniel, but his three friends, Shadrach, Meshak, and Abendigo. And when the instruments were played, everyone bowed down. Thousands of people on this plain and these three friends are standing straight. They stand out like a sore thumb, they’re very visible. And so the people who were like, enemies, you know, because there's all kind of infighting within the administration of these guys come and pointed out to the king. Do you see those three guys? They’re not obeying you. They're not bowing down as they should. So they are brought to Nebuchadnezzar and he says, is it true? Are you refusing to bow down? And we'll give you another chance. And they say this, O Nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you, If we are thrown into the glazing furnace, the God who we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, your majesty. This is is one of the most amazing statements in the Bible. And then what follows is even more awesome. But even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you, your majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up, 

Notice how they speak. They speak with such conviction, but honorably. They don't insult him. They're not despising him. They recognize him as your majesty. They speak honorably to him, but they will, they will not bend their convictions. They will not participate in idolatry. And so they're given another opportunity. They refuse to bow down. So they're tied and they're thrown into the flames and the fire is so hot, they’ve heated up 10 times. You can imagine this is, what would be modern day Iraq. And so this is probably a pit of petrochemicals of oil or tars, some kind that is just very intense. And the guards who get them close enough to the fire to throw them in, they burn up and die. 

And when Nebuchadnezzar looks in, he says, look, I see four men unbound walking around to the fire unharmed. And the fourth looks like a God. So not three that were thrown in, but four. And so he shouts onto to them Shadracq, Meshak and Abednigo, servants of the most High God, come out, come here. And then they came out and they were just fine. They'd been in this intense fire that immediately burned off the cords of the ropes and, and it killed the guards. But they, when they came out, they didn't, their clothing was not scorched and they didn't even smell like smoke it says. 

That's then Nebuchadnezzar said this. This is the end of this chapter. Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego\! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king's command and were willing to die rather than the serve  or worship. any god except their own God. Therefore I make this decree: If any people, whatever their race or nation language, speak against a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they will be torn from limb to limb. Their houses will be turned into heaps of re there's, no other God who can rescue you like this\!  Then the king promoted, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in the province of Babylon. 

There's several things to learn from this passage. There are times when we need to choose to obey God, rather than man. This, that phrase is also repeated by the apostles of the early church in Acts 5:29. And you may be in situations where you have to go against governing authorities, but notice how they did this, they did it respectfully and they did it believing that God could save them. But even if he didn't, if they had to die for their convictions, they were willing to die. They were willing to accept the consequences. They weren't hurting other people. They weren't destroying buildings, they weren't on a rampage, you know, tearing up their society. They were willing to suffer the consequences of their own choices, But they expected God to intervene. 

The amazing thing, another principle that we can get from this is that in this instance, and a couple more that we'll be looking at, it is always unwise for government to try to stipulate religious dos and don’ts. Government is there to safeguard justice and protected its citizens, not to establish religious practices. And so whenever that happens, there will be people who need to stand up against that, those wrong laws and follow the true God, the God of their conviction, the God of heaven and earth who saved these three and will save us too. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section, we'll be looking at includes Principles For The Executive Branch. We'll look at six different passages. 

**Government Sphere 23: The Law of the Kings.**   
This is found in Deuteronomy 17:14-20. You are about to enter the land that the Lord, your God is giving you. When you take it over and settle there, you may think we should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us. If this happens, be sure to select as king a man the Lord your God chooses. You must appoint a fellow Israelite. He may not be a foreigner. The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses. But the Lord has told you, you must never return to Egypt. The king must not take many wives from himself because they will turn his heart away from the Lord. And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself. 

When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way, he will learn to fear the Lord his God, by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees. This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he was above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and the descendants will reign for many generations in Israel. 

So among all the laws in the Original Testament, this particular section is that which is dedicated to the executive leadership of a government, the king. Or today you might be the prime minister or the president or the chancellor. And it says the three things that the, that the king should avoid. He should avoid multiplying horses, avoid multiplying wives and avoid multiplying gold. Now, the reason why these are specific injunctions for the king is because of his position or role, he has the capacity to increase these for himself. 

Well, what do these mean? What, what does Moses have against horses? Well, horses back in the day represented power. Because if you had an army with horses, you could field a Cavalry or you could set up a brigade with chariots. And that would be very powerful. If you didn’t have horses, you'd be limited to infantry. And so whoever had horses had military advantage, had a power advantage. It would be like having, you know, the latest missiles or drones or the stealth technology in warfare today. So to multiply horses had to do with an unrestrained increase and love for power. 

Similarly, you're not to multiply wives. This is giving yourself to a life of pleasure, of having a large harem and every night have multiple, pleasurable sexual fantasies come to life, which would be possible if you were a king and you could manage that. This was a life of pleasure. 

And finally not to multiply gold and silver. This is a love of things, of possessions. 

We could put these three words- horses, wives and gold into the language of power, sex and money. These are the three big temptations. Or say it another way. The love of power \- that's authoritarianism. The love of pleasure \- that’s hedonism or the love of things \- that’s materialism. These things can destroy the political process. These things corrupt government. These things can distract a king from what he really should be doing as serving the people. 

The biblical antidote for these three temptations are: instead of authoritarianism, servanthood; instead of hedonism, purity; instead of materialism, generosity. If we have governors and Kings and rulers that are servants and pure and generous, we'll have good governance. 

There's something more that's said in this passage that is really important. After saying what they should not multiply, it says that when this king sits on the throne, he's supposed to hand copy Deuteronomy for himself. Write out the laws for himself. That means take the time to go slow and meditate on it. And this says, he's supposed to take that personal copy and read it every single day. It says this regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud in acting as if he's above his fellow citizens. See, a king can multiply power, sex, and money like no ordinary citizen can. It creates a two-tiered society. It creates a double standard, an unlevel playing field. And if a king remembers that he is just one more person, has this level playing field reading the Bible establishes that day in and day out as a foundation of equality. So with that in mind, you're reminded to be a servant who's pure and generous. 

Read the Bible. If you're gonna reign, if you're gonna be a governor, if you're gonna be in politics, read the Bible every day. Listen, it'll help you govern. 

**Government Sphere 24: Solomon: Gold, Horses and Wives.**   
In our previous key passage, we looked at the law of a king and saw how we were not to multiply these three. In this passage we see that Solomon multiplied all three. The passage goes from 1 Kings 10:1 \-11:13 Because it is a chapter and a half, I won't read the whole thing, but let me give you some highlights. But do take time to go through this in your scriptures. 

It begins with a visit of the Queen of Sheba and she comes to visit Solomon because she's heard of his wisdom. And she says this, everything I heard from my country about your achievements and wisdom is true. I didn't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I not heard that half of it. Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what I was told, how happy your people must be. What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom, praise the Lord, your God who delights in you has placed you on the thought of Israel. 

Now that sounds like a wonderful affirmation. He's got these amazing banquets, this limitless food. He's got these well dressed officials. I mean his personal bodyguard are carrying golden shields, and she's overwhelmed. But we have to remember, be careful how you quote the Bible. These words are the words of a pagan queen. She does not have God's value system. As you, though, she praises him, this story is told and it unpacks first how he multiplied gold and then how he multiplied wives and how multiplied horses. It unpacks these things to show that he violated everything that God intended for a king to do. This is not a good report. Her statement is a statement of a confused pagan monarch who had an ungodly, non-kingdom of God value system. 

Let’s look at what he did as we read this, because at the very end of this passage, it's gonna tell us that Solomon did what was evil in the Lord's sight. 

The Lord was very angry with Solomon for his heart had turned away from the Lord the God of Israel who appeared to him twice. He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the Lord's command. So now the Lord said to him, since you have not kept my covenant and disobeyed my decrees. I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants. But for the sake of your father David, I will not do this while you are still alive. I'll take the kingdom away from your son. 

Solomon did not please God. He started off well, but ended up very poorly because he did not heed the law of the Kings. All three aspects, he did wrong. 

Let's look at the horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. Way too many for a kingdom as small as his. Yes, Israel was largest under Solomon's reign than it was under any other king, but still that was extravagant for their military needs. 

And gold? Well, it says that, as it recites in this passage the taxes he took in, it says that he bought in 666 talents of gold every year, plus so many more talents of silver and bronze. And he talks about wood and spices and all of these things. So there's huge tax burden. Let me just focus on this gold. 6, 6, 6 talents. That number is not accidental. You probably, when you hear that number, you think of the antichrist. Well, precisely. This number was so- was such a gross amount of taxation that it became emblematic. It became symbolic of everything that was anti-God, that harmed people that was not serving to the benefit of the people. And so this is why in the book of Revelation, this number was picked up to be used to describe the antichrist. This is anti-God. 

How much is a talent? A talent is 75 pounds. So 666 talents is 49,950 pounds or in kilos over 22,700 kilos. Gold is measured in ounces. There are 16 ounces per pound and at today's rate, which is about $1,775 an ounce. That would be $14.2 billion that he brought in. And that's just the gold, not counting the silver and the bronze, all the other elements of taxation \- for a country that's you can today drive from the south to the north in three hours. How could you possibly spend that much? 666 tons. They only used 79 talents of gold for the temple, which is the most luxurious building ever. And this is like eight, nine times more than that every single year. It was unhealthy. 

Remember that when he dies and his son Reheboam becomes king and ascends to the throne, he calls in advisors and the people gather and say, would you please lower the taxes? We're dying. This was the real story. The Queen of Sheba’s assessment was wrong. She only was in the palace and she was eating all the splendid food, but the people were suffering. The taxes were way too high. They said, please lower the taxes. Rehaboam checked with their old counselors. And they said, yes, heed the people and they’ll follow you. And they talked with his young friends, who'd grown up in the palace with him and loved all the magnificent food and all the splendid decorations. And they said, oh no, no, increase it. We want more, we want more. And greed won the day. And when he said I'm gonna increase the taxes. He said my little finger will be thicker than my father's thigh \- is like, it's split the kingdom \-10 tribes split away. And for the next 400 years almost, there was war and deaths and so much suffering because Solomon had not trained himself or trained, not trained his son to say, this is enough. 

I mean, come on. You're making shields of gold? That's the ultimate hubris. That's like pride on maximum display. Gold is so soft a spear would go through it. And so heavy, they had to be really small little shields. They weren't really protecting anyone of the guard. They would just say, who's gonna attack us. We're we're invincible. We don't need real shields. We can show off our gold this way. This was a point of extraordinary pride. And so grievous to God because he lived in this luxury while the people suffered greatly. 

And then, not only did he multiply the horses and the gold, but the wives. He had 700 wives and 300 concubines. The concubines often were ones who caught the King’s eye, and he said, bring them into the haram and spent one night with her and then decided he didn't want to make her a wife. And it was maybe just that one night that he spent with her and the rest of her life was wasted. It's a terrible thing. A thousand women. Did he even know their names? Could he remember when he was last with them? Is there any true love in any of that? 

Is there any true love in that? Solomon did evil in the Lord's eyes. God was not pleased. He was not serving the people. He was serving his own lust. Lust for power, lust for pleasure, and lust for things. 

**Government Sphere 25: Asa: A Good King Goes Bad.**   
2 Chronicles 16:9. In the early part of his reign, Asa had faced great odds of battle that he should have lost. And he trusted God, and God did a miraculous thing. And he got an extraordinary victory. But later on in his life, when he was again facing an enemy, he, instead of looking to God, he tried to make allies with a pagan nation. Then the prophet came and said this:

the eyes of the Lord searched the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts who are fully committed to him. What a fool you have been. From now on, you will be at war. 

These were the words that the prophet spoke to king Asa, when he relied on his own strength and his own ingenuity and his own strategy, rather than looking to God to really guide and direct him to be his ultimate protector. 

If you're working in government or in any other sphere, it's always good to remember is not how you begin the race, but how you finish it, that determines whether or not you win or lose. 

In the books of first and second Chronicles, as well as the first and second Kings, there’s a sobering review of governmental leaders over four centuries, multiple kingdoms. And unfortunately, there are not many good reports. Some begin bad and continue bad. Some begin good like Asa, but turn bad in the process. All of these stories are to be a sober warning.

So take heed and be warned. The temptations are many. So if you are called to serve in the area of government, seek God, seek him diligently. Remember the law of the Kings and stay true to the very end. 

**Government Sphere 26: Manasseh: A Bad King Goes Good.**   
This particular passage is the encouraging counterpoint to the previous one. We find this in 2 Chronicles 33:1-20. Again, this is a long passage. So I'll let you read most of it on your own. The first many verses are cataloging, detailing all the many sins that Manassah did. All the idolatries, all the pagan temples that he built and places that he worshiped. He ruled longer than any other king of Judah, over 50 years. But at the very end, something happened. 

But while in deep distress, Manasseh sought the Lord his God and sincerely humbled himself before the God of his ancestors. And when he prayed, the Lord listened to him and was moved by his request. It goes on to say that Manasseh’s prayer, the account of the way God answered him and account of all of his sins and unfaithfulness are recorded in the record of the Seers. This is a wonderful passage and it gives us great hope. 

Now, let me just tell you some of the evils that he did this. You could unpack this for a very long time, but one of the things that highlights is that he sacrificed to Molech. Molech was a Canaanite God that was a stone statue of granite stone that had a hollowed out belly. And when they worship Molech, they would put fire around the stone until it heated up ‘til oven hot. And then they take a, a newborn child or an infant, and place it in the belly of Molech, hot, hot stone, and literally have the child sizzle to death, cook him before their god, cook him alive. Horrific, horrific scene. 

And this was in some way, giving up of your seed, of your descendants, you know, in hopes for greater financial wellbeing or better harvest, or other kinds of just distorted ways of thinking, sacrificing the most innocent for financial benefit. And this was the worst, worst of imaginable kind of idolatry. But even so, this story's told to us in this details, details, all of these terrible things he did, and it tells us of this repentance because there's always hope. Repentance is always possible. A bad king can turn good. So remember what we're told in 1 Timothy 2, pray for the Kings and those in authority. Repentance is possible. 

I want to just read his prayer that Manasseh wrote. It is not among the 66 books that we Protestants use, but it's in the \_\_\_\_\_canonical books that are used by Catholics and Orthodox. And it's a beautiful, beautiful prayer.

And even though everyone might not consider this to be fully scripture, fully authoritative, it has so much insight into the ways of God. Manasseh prays this. And the wonderful thing of course, is that the scriptures refer to his prayer as being noteworthy. So let's read these words. I'm gonna start in the middle of the prayer.

Immeasurable and unsearchable is your promised mercy, he’s saying to God. For you are the Lord most high of great compassion, long suffering and very merciful and you relent at man's suffering. O Lord, according to your great goodness, you've promised repentance and forgiveness to those who have sinned against you and in the multitude of your mercies, you have appointed repentance for sinners so that they may be saved.

Therefore you, oh Lord, God of the righteous have not appointed repentance for the righteous for Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and who did not sin against you, but you've appointed repentance for me, who am sinner. 

For this and that verse. Maybe why is not included in the scriptures because Abraham, Isaac and Jacob did sin. But in his, in his passion of repenting himself, of repenting before God, he sees them as so much more righteous than he was. He says for the sin, I have committed are more number than the sand of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied, oh Lord, they are multiplied. I'm not worthy to look up and see the height of heaven, because of the multitude of my iniquities. I'm weighed down with many an iron fetter so that I'm rejected it because of my sins. And I have no relief. For I've provoked your wrath I've done what is evil in your sight, setting up abomination and multiplying offenses. And now I've bend the knee of my heart, imploring you for your kindness and is one of the most beautiful statements I know I bend the knee of my heart, imploring you for your kindness. I have sinned O Lord. I have sin and I acknowledge my transgressions. I earnestly implore you. Forgive me O Lord. Forgive me. Do not destroy me with my transgressions. Do not be angry with me forever or store up evil for me, do not condemn me to the depths of the earth for you. O Lord are the God of those who repent. And in me, you'll manifest your goodness for unworthy as I am, You'll save me according to your great mercy. And I will praise you constantly all the days of my life for all the hosts of heaven sings your praise and yours is the glory forever. Amen. 

Now that's an amazing prayer of repentance. 

**Government Sphere 27: Give to Caesar What Is Caesar’s.**   
Mark 12:13-17.  Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested. Teacher, they said, we know how honest you are. You are impartial and don't play favorites. You teach the way of God truthfully. Now tell us \- is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them? Or shouldn't we? Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, why are you trying to trap me? Show me a Roman coin and I'll tell you. When they handed it to him, he asked who's picture and title are stamped on it? Caesar’s, they replied. Well, then Jesus said, give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give to God who belongs to God. His reply completely amazed them. 

You can tell that there were, they were up to no good when the Pharisees and the Herodians came together, because they were usually enemies. The Pharisees were anti-Roman and all pro God. The Herodians were the ones who were for the political establishment and willing to compromise religiously. And when they posed this question, he would be siding either with one group or the other, and half of the society, the pro Romans would be upset or the anti Romans would be upset. And, it was a lose \- lose situation, no matter how He answered it. 

So he didn't answer it.  Instead He turned around and asked them a question and it exposed the duplicity of their hearts. And then he said this very important thing, give to Caesar, what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s. Don't pit these things against each other. Don't pit governance against spirituality. Don't pit politics against the church. Don't don't do that. These spheres can collaborate together and you don't have to choose one over and against the other. There's an appropriate place to give to government. And there's an appropriate place to give to God, not an either or scenario, but at both/and, in which the role of both are recognized and affirmed. Of course, as those ever conflict between the two, God has to take preeminence. 

**Government Sphere 28: (Biblical Civil Disobedience \#2)**  
At the end of this section on the executive branch, we're gonna look at a second passage from the book of Daniel about Biblical Civil Disobedience. This one is from Daniel 1:5-20. Now, we have to just put yourselves in Daniel's shoes. He was probably, he and his friends were probably between 14 and 17 years of age when they were taken to Babylon as prisoners. This was the first of several times that Nebuchadnezzer raided Jerusalem. And what was the custom was in those days that they sent the top sons of the political leaders and the economic leaders, the cultural leaders as prisoners, as hostages to the court of the conquering kingdom. So if there was any rebellion in the subjugated kingdom, in this case, the kingdom of Judah, the sons of the upper class would be killed. So their being taken hostage was a way to gain assurance of the non rebellious plots against Babylon. 

And as they were brought into the palace, you know, something tragic happened to these four young teenage men who all have dreams of a life and marriage and families of their own. And they're made eunuchs. They're castrated, because every male in the palace, other than the king, is castrated to make sure that there's no hanky panky with anyone in the harem, that only the harem and the king is the only one who has sexual intercourse with them. So just think of a young teenage boy, all the hopes and dreams is like their future is zero. They're never gonna get married, never gonna have children, their family line ends with them. It would lead to great resentment and bitterness. But that is not what Daniel and these three friends do. They determine to follow God in his ways and the midst of this hostile situation that absolutely uprooted and destroyed their life. 

It says that- I'm not gonna read the whole passage, but it says \-Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. So he asked the chief of staff for permission to not eat these unacceptable foods. Now the chief of staff said, listen, if you don't eat these foods and you only eat vegetables and water, like you have suggested, the king, you're going be look skinnier, and the king is going to think that I'm stealing the food. I'm not feeding you everything. And I'm profiting off of the budget that he's allocated for me to take care of you. And they're trying to be follow the kosher laws of their Jewish faith. 

And so instead of just rebelling, they come up with a creative solution. They say, please test us for 10 days. Let's try it out. I understand your concern. We don't want to get you in trouble with the king, but at the end of the 10 days, see how we look compared to the other young men. If we look scrawnier, okay? If we don't look healthy, then you make your decision in light of what you see. 

So they understand the needs of their political leaders and cooperate with them, but in such a way that they can stay true to their principles. And at the end of 10 days they looked healthier and stronger than anyone else. God honored their a commitment and God gave the four young men told unusual aptitude and they were 10 times more capable than any of the magicians and enchanters in his entire realm, kingdom. 

So hear the principles. When you are uncomfortable with its imposed upon you by government, give a creative solution, understand what government is trying to do, find a different way to do that, and then be willing to accept the consequences. After 10 days, we'll do whatever you say. And if you stay true to God, amazing things are going to happen. And this is the way we bring about change. When we have issues of conscious that are contrary to government's decisions. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
Having considered together the Principles for the Executive branch. We will now look at five passages that deal with Principles for the Judicial Branch.    
**Government Sphere 29: Selection, Role and Character of Judges.** 

Deuteronomy 1:15-17.  So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for 50 and some for 10\. And at that time I instructed the judges, You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you.

Be perfectly fair in your decisions and impartial in your judgments. Hear are the cases of those who are poor, as well as those who are rich. Don't be afraid of anyone's anger, for the decision you make is God's decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you. And I will handle them. 

There's several things that we learned from these passages. First of all, the judicial system has to be based on the principle of absolute equity. Perfectly fair, totally impartial. If you don't get special treatment because you're rich, you don't get special treatment because you're poor. Neither ones less or more, you're impartial in your judgments. 

The second thing we see is that an appellate system is established here. There are some who are judges over a thousand people, some over a hundred, some over 50 and some over 10\. So you start at the lower court level. If those can't solve it at the 10 level, they push it up and they push it up. And if even those who are at the upper level judges over a thousand, can't determine then Moses is like the Supreme court \- bring any cases that are too difficult for you to me, he says.

So we see in this passage principles that continue to guide our judicial system, how it has worked and how it should continue to work into the future. It's rooted in biblical insight. 

**Government Sphere 30: Equity in Judgment.**   
Leviticus 19:15 do not twist justice in legal matters by favoring the poor or by being partial to the rich and powerful. Always judge people fairly.

Absolute equity. Depending on your personality or your position, you might be tempted to disadvantage the rich because you're trying to advocate for the poor. Or you might be sucking up to the rich and powerful and so you ignore the poor. Neither of those are acceptable. You can't go into a judgment with predetermined favoritism. You have to judge with equity. Judge all people fairly. 

**Government Sphere 31: Advocate for the Oppressed.**   
This is taken from Exodus 3:9-18. This is the passage in which Moses and God have a conversation and God is giving Moses instructions, preparing him to go down to Egypt. God begins talking and it really is God's heart is the reason why this conversation is going to happen. 

Look, he says to Moses, the cry of the people of Israel has reached me. And I have seen how harshly the Egyptians abuse them. 

I'm gonna skip a few verses and go on and says, he comes up and says, at the end, I have been watching closely and I see how the Egyptians are treating you. I’ve promised to rescue you from your oppression in Egypt. I will lead you in a land flowing with milk and honey \- the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.  The elders of Israel will accept your message. Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt and tell 'em the Lord. The God of the Hebrews has met with us. So please let us take a three day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord or God. 

Our acts of justice must be rooted in the heart of God. It's he, the most just God, the most fair God, the one who’s heart grieves over injustice, who’s tender and sensitive to the cries of the oppressed. This is what motivates him to act and should motivate us to act. Here, getting to know God and his heart for the poor and needy of the world, the oppressed of the world is that which should inspire us to work on their behalf. 

**Government Sphere 32: Verdicts That Produce Peace.**   
Zechariah 8:16, but this is what you must do. Tell the truth to each other. Render verdicts in your courts that are just and lead to peace. 

Wow, this is so clear. This must be the purpose of the law and the judicial process. Look at the three key words here. Truth, justice, peace; truth, justice, peace. That's why we have a judicial system. 

**Government Sphere 33: Solomon's Legal Wisdom.**    
1 Kings 3:16-28. This is one of the best known stories in the Bible. Sometime later two prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled. Please my Lord. One of them began this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby while she was with me at the house. A few days later, this woman also had a baby. We were alone. There were only two of us in the house, but her baby died the night when she rolled over on it. And she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep. She laid to her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her. And in the morning when I tried to nurse my son, he was dead. But when I looked more closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't my son at all. Then the other woman interrupted. It certainly was your son and the living child is mine. No, the first woman said. The living child is mine and the dead one is yours. And so they argued back and forth before the king. Then the king said, let's get the facts straight. Both of you claim the living child is yours. And each says that the dead one belongs to the other. All right, bring me a sword. So a sword was brought to the king. Then he said, cut the living child in two and give half to one woman, and the other half to the other. Then the woman who was the real mother of the living child and who loved him very much better. Oh no, my Lord give her the child. Please do not kill him. But the other woman said, all right, he'll be neither yours nor mine divided between us. And the king said, do not kill the child but give them to the woman who wants him to live for she is his mother. When all Israel's birth, the King's decision that people in all of the king, where they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice. 

We see the incredible wisdom of God upon Solomon in the early part of his reign. He knew how to ferret out the truth in the midst of a courtroom trial. He was a great prosecuting attorney. He knew how to play the emotions of the courtroom in just such a way to have that faux pas occur in the, in the guilty woman. And so that he could expose the true motives and decide who was really telling the truth and who wasn't. 

We need a lot of wisdom. We need God's wisdom to handle many cases that are hard to decide even to this day. 

So may we learn from these scriptures. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
Now we have five passages that give us the principles for the Legislative branch. 

**Government Sphere 34: Laws Are To Be Life-giving.**   
Ezekiel 33:15. For instance, they might give back a better security returning what they have stolen and obey my life-giving laws no longer doing what is evil. If they do this, then they will surely live and not die. 

Here is the key principle. For those who are creating laws, legislators, laws are to give life, laws are to enhance life, laws are to protect life. Laws that do this are in keeping with God's character. Laws that do not do this are contrary to his character. 

**Government Sphere 35: Moses Decrees Good Laws.**   
Deuteronomy 4:4-5. But all of you who are were faithful to the Lord, your God are still alive today. Every one of you look, I now teach you these degrees and regulations just as the Lord my God commanded me so that you may obey them. The land you allowed to enter and occupy. 

The whole biblical narrative is that God's laws, the laws through Moses were given so that people would thrive in the land. They'd inherit the land, a land flowing with milk and honey God's intention was always good for them. 

God's revelation through Moses was good \- good laws that helped people live good lives in the good land that God was promising them. If they obeyed them, they would thrive.

**Government Sphere 36: Darius Decrees a Bad Law.**   
Daniel 6:6-9. So the administrators in the high officers went to the King and said long lived king Darius. We were all in agreement. We administrators officials, high officers, advisors and governors that the King should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next 30 days, any person who prays to anyone, divine or human, except to you, your majesty, will be thrown into den of lions. And now your majesty issue and sign this law so cannot be changed an official law of the Medes and the Persians that cannot be revoked. So king Darius signed the law 

Now in passage, number 38, just a little bit later, we're gonna look at the rest of the story and see how Daniel had to respond to this. But Darius was swayed by pride. He listened to the adulations of bureaucrats in his administration who are trying to oust to Daniel and position themselves more prominently in the government. And the law that he signed- he was basically hoodwinked by these advisors. He was unwise. He was, as they catered to his pride, he signed a law that restricted human freedom. Any laws that restrict human freedom, telling them what you can or can't believe, who you can or can't worship. Any laws that try to dictate the rules of conscience are not to be accepted. And so this was a bad law and it was gonna have bad consequences as we'll see soon in another one of our passages.

**Government Sphere 37: Cities of Refuge.**   
Government Spheres 35:9-15. The Lord said to Moses, give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan designate cities of refuge, to which people can flee if they've killed someone accidentally. These cities will be places of protection from a dead person's relatives who want to avenge the death. The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community, designate six cities of refuge for yourselves to be on the east side of the Jordan and three on the west in the land of Canaan. These cities are for protection of Israelites, foreigners living among you and traveling merchants. Anyone who accidentally kills someone may flee there for safety. 

This is really specific legislation and even shows how to administer it. It sets aside six cities designates where they are. But the point here of this legislation is that recognize that there are different kinds of killings. Some are intentional, have a motive, and some are accidental. And today we call the accidental ones manslaughter, and the intentional ones, homicide or murder. 

And the legislation is going into place laws to help protect those who commit manslaughter. They didn't intend to kill someone. Maybe what, whatever happened. Someone died, maybe they were playing with something and a rock got loose and rolled down the hill and crushed the person's skull. And he died. It was not intentional. And by the law of reprisal, there would be a tooth for tooth and eye for an eye. But because this was an, an accidental death, there was provision made to save this person. 

But there was also limitations. Once you moved into that city of refuge, we read in other passages that you had to remain there until the death of the high priest, the current reigning high priest. And so there were consequences, even though it was accidental, but your life was spared. You did not suffer the same consequences as if you had done homicide. Wise legislation takes into consideration motivation and circumstances.

**Government Sphere 38: (Biblical Civil Disobedience \#3)**   
This is the third and final passage from Daniel on Biblical Civil Disobedience. This concludes the story of Darius's bad law in which he commanded that only he be worshiped for 30 days. We find in Daniel 6:10-24. Instead of reading you the story from Daniel 6, I'm gonna tell you about it. And together we'll see this well known story of Daniel in the lion’s den how significant it is. It's more than the child's story is the story of the most essential principles needed for governance in God's kingdom and in the kingdoms of human beings.

Once Darius had signed the law and Daniel heard about it, he did what he did every day. He didn't hide. He was bold about it. He prayed three times a day to the God of heaven. And just to make sure that people understood that he was not backing down on his convictions it says, quite deliberately that he flung the shutters of his windows open. So he prayed so that everyone could see. He was not doing this in hiding and in secret. He was making his stand for religious freedom. Those who designed the law and tricked the king into making this law quickly noted this and reported this breaking of the law to Darius. And by then it was too late. 

He realized that out of envy, these other advisors had suggested this law because they wanted to get rid of Daniel. He was heartbroken. And it says that he did everything he could do to try to avoid this. He didn't, he didn't go and hang out with his harem. He didn't have food. He prayed. He looked at other ways that he could solve this problem. And there was no solution. 

I want to use some words here that are very important for us to understand. This I've written in another place. We've already mentioned that the interplay of justice and mercy is one of the main themes about government. And it's one of the main overarching themes of the scripture. 

This story highlights one of the main themes of the Bible, the interplay of justice and mercy, and how important it's to understand in the sphere of government, as in many other areas of life. This story from Daniel chapter six is so crucial for our understanding. You see, king Darius loves Daniel, his most trustworthy advisor. The other royal counselors were envious and devised a plot to rid themselves of Daniel. They tricked king Darius into passing an unjust law, which prohibited everyone to worship anyone other than Darius for a span of 30 days. 

While Daniel would have nothing to do with his new law and went on worshiping God in his usual way. When his rivals caught him in the act of prayer, they quickly reported their findings to Darius and demanded that Daniel be brought to justice and be sentenced to death. Darius realized all too late his error, but was now bound by law he himself had signed.

As king he could not justly waive Daniel's penalty while requiring it to be paid by others. To do so would be to govern with a double standard. This would be evidence of gross partiality and an inequitable application of the law. If he did not punish Daniel as stipulated by the law, disrespect for the law and injustice would be encouraged throughout the land. As king he understood that he had to uphold the law; justice demanded it, but at the same time he wanted to spare Daniel mercy desired it. What could he do? 

Darius was greatly distressed. He was determined to rescue Daniel and made an effort, every effort until sun down to save him. Daniel 6:14. But he could find no way. Even though he wanted to show mercy to Daniel, justice had to be upheld. And so it was that Daniel had to be thrown into the lion’s den and a stone placed over the top. what a dark day, that was, it seemed that all was lost in Daniel's life was doomed in anguish. The king return to his palace spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him, Daniel 6:18. 

But with the coming of dawn, a surprising discovery transformed the King's bleak despair into exceeding joy. At day break, when they removed the stone from the lions’ den they discovered much to their surprise that Daniel was still alive. God had wonderously intervened and had done what the king could not do. The divine intervention had made it possible for the law to be upheld and Daniel's life to be spared both at the same time. Justice was vindicated and mercy demonstrated. What a great thing that was for both Darius and Daniel. 

Darius concludes by praising God saying for he is a living God and he endures forever. His kingdom will not be destroyed. His dominion will never end. He rescues. And he saves, he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth. What was the sign of wonder God had performed? In saving Daniel's life from the lions God had found a way for both justice and mercy to have full expression. That was truly extraordinary. 

This story foretells an amazing redemptive work of God on the cross. At Calvary, the age long dilemma, blending justice and mercy finds perfect solution. At one and the same time justice is satisfied and mercy is extended. Paul tells us that Jesus became a sacrifice of atonement in order to demonstrate his justice. So has to be just, and the one who justifies those who are faith in Jesus, Romans 3:25-26. In other words, at the cross, the law is upheld and forgiveness is made possible. 

This is the one and only point in all of human history where justice and mercy are perfectly fused together in an extraordinary blend of redemptive purpose. 

Government has a call to uphold justice and every time they can do that mercifully it is desirable. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
The Bible is extraordinarily practical. For leaders in government it even gives teachings instructions about appropriate ways to do War and Peace. Let's look at these next five passages and see what we learned from the scriptures. 

**Government Sphere 39: Laws for War.**   
This comes from Deuteronomy 20:1-20. I'll read sections of this. When you go out to fight your enemies and you face horses and chariots and an army greater than you own, do not be afraid. The Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt is with you… do not be afraid as you go out to fight your enemies today\! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble before them for the Lord your God is going with you… 

Now, the officers of the army must address the troops just before the battle and say this- has anyone who just built a new house, but not yet dedicated it? If so you may go home\! You might be killed in the battle and someone else would dedicate your house. Has anyone here just planted a vineyard…? people raising their hands. Well but not yet eating any of its fruit if so you may go home. You might die in battle and someone else would eat the first fruit. Has anyone who just become engaged to a woman, but not yet married her? Well, you may go home and get married. You might die battle and someone else would marry her. 

Then the officers will also say, is anyone here afraid or worried? If you are, you may go home before you frighten anyone else. don't want you in our troop \- Okay. When the officers have finished speaking to their troops, they will appoint the unit commanders. They whittled everybody down. We know everyone there is focused and ready, and then they give these instructions. As you approach a town to attack it, you must first offer its people terms of peace. You don't just go and attack people without warning. If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor. But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town. 

Now, wonderful, wonderful principles. Because there are going to be conflicts in nations. So how do you do it right? 

So you must completely destroy the Hittites. Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you. 

This is the peoples who are living in the land of Canaan where Israel is to take possession. Why would he say that? Well, he gives a good reason. 

This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you to sin deeply against the Lord your God. 

And then this whole section ends with this interesting teaching. 

When you are attacking a town and the war drags on you must not cut down the trees with your axes.  You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the trees. Are the trees your enemies that you should attack them? You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food. Use them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls. 

So let's just review some of the things. Talking about not fearing. If you're going to have an army going to battle, you want to have people who are ready to engage with their whole heart. This is a part of the training, part of the equipping. Secondly it goes through several of cases of people who are excused from the battle. If you've just gotta have new house, if you've planted a vineyard and not enjoyed its fruit yet, if you just engaged and not enjoyed the advantages of being newly married and well, if you're worried or afraid, then you're excused. 

You should always give towns an offer of peace. And the reason you kill is because you do not want to do what they do in worshipping other false gods. And don't cut down the trees. Just think of this principle. Don't raise the raise the ground. We see some battles today and throughout history where its just a scorched earth policy. And after the war is done, it's just generations and decades and decades until there's fruitful and livable once again. He says there are conflicts between nations. There should be some parameters around what is right and what is wrong. Obviously peace is preferable to war, but if you do it in a way, get the battle over with and leave the environment alone so the next generation can have a fresh start. 

**Government Sphere 40: Diplomacy versus War.**   
This comes from 2 Samuel 10:1-8. Sometime after this king Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king. David said, I'm going to show loyalty to Hanun just as his father, Nahash was always loyal to me. So David sent ambassadors to express sympathy to Hanun about his father's death. But when David's ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon, the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their master, do you really think there's these men are coming here to honor your father? No\! David has sent them to spy out the city so they can come in and conquer it. So Hanun seized David's ambassadors and shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their robes at the buttocks and sent them back to David in shame. When David heard what it happened, he sent messengers to tell the men, stay at Jericho until your beards grow out and then come back. 

It was a shameful in that context and that culture of that day to, to have your beard cut. For they felt deep shame because of their appearance. When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, they sent and hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from the lands of Beth-rehob and Zobah, 1,000 from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 from the land of Tob. When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them. The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.

In this story, David sends two groups of people. First he sent ambassadors to establish treaties and continuity of peace with the transition of the rule from the king who had passed away to his son, the crown prince would now become king. He wanted to establish peace, but the whispering of the, his counselors made him doubt the sincerity of that offer. So he prepared for war. So instead of peace, instead of diplomacy, instead of a treaty, war ensued. 

So first David sent ambassadors, then he sent Joab and all his warriors. How wise it would've been if the young king had received the ambassadors and honored them and established a treaty. It would've been no loss of life. Peace is so much better. 

In summary, David tried diplomacy first, but when that failed, he resorted to war. Romans 12:18 brings application today for all of us. It says do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. It doesn't mean that you are always gonna live in peace with everyone. Do all you can. They may not participate, they may not reciprocate, but you try to be a peacemaker. Whether that's a personal level or a governmental level, that should be our attitude. 

**Government Sphere 41: Civil War Destroys a Nation.**   
This is a passage in the gospels in Jesus will speak. We read in Luke 11:17. Jesus knew their thoughts where he said any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A kingdom divided against itself will fall is another translation. Civil war is a great tragedy. If you look at the wars throughout history, the ones that are most devastating, most violent, most destructive, and have most enduring consequences that go on for generations are those among those who are close brothers and, and family and clans, they're those civil wars. And they should be avoided if at all possible it. It is a horrible tragedy and Jesus recognizes this and warns us against it. 

**Government Sphere 42: Edom Judged for War Time Disloyalty.**   
This comes from the prophet Obadiah 1:11-15. When they were invaded \[This is speaking of Jerusalem and Judah to being invaded\] you stood aloof refusing to help them. Foreign invaders carried off their wealth and cast lots to divide up to Jerusalem. But you acted like one of Israel's enemies. You should not have gloated when they exiled your relatives to distant lands, you should not have rejoiced when the people of Judah suffered such misfortune, you should not have spoken arrogantly in that terrible time of trouble. You should not have plundered the land of Israel when there were suffering such calamity. You should not have gloated over their destruction when they were suffering such calamity. You should not have seized their wealth when they were suffering such calamity. You should not have stood at the crossroads killing those who tried to escape. You should not have captured the survivors and handed them over in their terrible time of trouble. The day is near when I the Lord will judge all godless nations. As you've done to Israel so be done to you. All your evil deeds will fall back on your own heads. 

Did you hear how many times the prophet said you should not have? You should not have, you should not have. Okay. So the nation of Edom of descendants of Esau, who was Israel’s  brother and so Jacob is Israel. So there had been enmity going back generations, but they were still family. They were still related. And so when the Babylonians and other enemies came and attacked Jerusalem, you expected family loyalty to kick in, but they took advantage of their cousins, distant cousins’ misfortune. 

If you are a government leader and you see some nation being attacked and destroyed, you kind of sit by and kind of gloat, because you are rejoicing in their downfall because you can position yourself in the power struggle among nations a little bit more. Be warned. That attitude is very dangerous. And God says that you're godless if you act this way. This is not the right way to act. And if you act this way, what you've done to others will be done to you. Don't gloat over someone else's demise, whether that's an individual or another nation. If you rejoice in another's calamity, it will likely befall you in due time. 

**Government Sphere 43: Elisha “Defeats" The King of Aram.**   
This is the last this section of War and Peace. One of my favorite passages in scripture. I'm gonna read it and its entirety. It is fairly long. 2 Kings 6:8-23. I'll pause in between and just unpack it for you. 

Now, when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, we will mobilize our forces at such and such a place, but immediately Elisha, the man of God, the prophet would warn the king of Israel. 

So king \- picture the king of Aman and council of war with his commanders. And when he makes a plan, the prophet hears from God and God saying this is gonna happen so they can never be caught off guard. 

So Elisha would warn the king of Israel, do not go near that place for the Armenians are planning to mobilize their troops there. So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again, Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there. The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, which one of you is a traitor? 

See there's this whole army that is being defeated by the insight that this one prophet is because he knows how to hear God- and the King's paying attention to him. So it's just, all of these plans are being frustrated. He is certain that there's a traitor. 

Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans? It's not us my lord the king, one of the officers replied. Elisha, the prophet in Israel. He tells the king of Israel, even the word you speak in the privacy of your bedroom. Go and find out where he is, the king commanded so I can send trips to seize him. 

So now his military target is not the king and the King's armies, but this one solitary prophet, because until he kills this prophet, he can't win the wars. 

So the report came back. Elisha is at Dothan, a small little, wall \-less city, and in the north of Israel. And so one night the king of Arab sent a great army with many chariots and horses around this to surround the city. 

When the servant of the man got up early in the next morning, went outside, you know, he’s stretching and getting ready to look up for the day, washing his face and looks up. And, oh my goodness. there, there were troops horses and chariots everywhere. And he goes running into him and says, Oh sir, what will we do now? The young man cried to Elisha. 

Don't be afraid, Elisha told him, for there are more on our side than on theirs\! Then Elisha prayed O Lord open his eyes and let him see. And the Lord opened the young man's eyes. And when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire. 

That's where we get the name of the movie about the 1924 Olympics in Paris, Chariots of Fire. And so here's one prophet and his servant surrounded by the Aramean forces. And they are surrounded by the forces of heaven, these angelic warriors. 

As the Armean is advanced  army advanced toward Elisha prayed, oh Lord, please make them blind. 

Now he just prayed that his servant would see what you normally couldn't see. And now he prays that the Armenian army goes blind. 

So the Lord struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked. 

So imagine thousands and thousands of soldiers and charioteers and they're all instantly blind. They're in an unfamiliar territory. There must have been panic in the crowd. 

And then Elisha went out and told him, you've come the wrong way. This isn't the right city. Follow me. And I'll take you to the man you're looking for. 

And so that's all it says, but from Dothan to Samaria is quite a way. And I imagine it was kind of like, I like they're all blind. Maybe he put a rope and like a teacher with eight or 10 from kindergarten going on a field trip, everyone hold onto the rope. I don't want anyone to get lost or hold onto the shoulder of the one in front of you. And, and the whole army goes single file, being led by the prophet with its huge army banners, probably trailing a, a kilometer or two or mile or two. And he led them to the city of Samaria. As soon as they enter Samaria, Elisha prayed, O Lord, now open their eyes and let them see. 

So now they're in the city, the king and his army are all around. And, they're in the city. I mean, you're supposed to keep this enemy outside. And but when the king of Israel saw them, he shouted Elisha. My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them? Like the king doesn't know what to do. What should I kill him? And Elisha says, of course not. Do we kill prisoners of war? 

Thoughts of the Geneva Convention are based on this passage of how we treat people in war. Do we kill prisoners of war? The answer is no. What do we do when someone comes into our town? We show hospitality. So he says, give them food and drink and send them home again to their master. So the king made a great feast for them and sent them home to their master. After that the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel. 

What a great way to solve the war problem. You hear from God, you listen to the prophet. If they'd fought a battle that day and people had died, three months later, there'd be another battle. And the year after that, there'd be another battle. And there'd be after another battle. But because of this incredible strategy battle ceased. 

We need prophets who hear from God of what evil is being planned against our nation. And the leaders of the nations, like the king of Samira need to be willing to listen to those prophets and be willing to act in bold and in unconventional ways. Every king, every president should pray to have our prophet like Elisha. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we in government learn how to hear from God and act in such kingdom ways that wars would cease? 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

 This next section is about Government and Healthcare. And we’ll look at three passages. 

**Government Sphere 44: Establishing Healthy Societal Conditions.**   
This comes from Deuteronomy 23:9-14. When you go to war against your enemies, be sure to stay away from anything that is impure. Any man who becomes ceremonially defiled because of a nocturnal emission, must leave the camp and stay away all day. Toward evening he must bathe himself and that sunset, he may return to the camp. You must have a designated area outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. Each of you must have a spade as part of your equipment. Whenever you relieve yourself, dig a hole with a spade and cover the excrement. The camp must be holy for the Lord Your God moves around in your camp to protect you and to defeat your enemies. He must not see any shameful thing among you or he will turn away from you. 

So I have a friend who talks about this passage and how God instructs the kings to make sure that the society is practicing good, healthy community development principles in terms of their hygiene. And so if you have to relieve yourself, you just don't just go behind your tent and poo you go to a particular area, and you take a little spade, make a hole and then cover it up so the place remains clean. Because God's walking amongst you. And you don't wanna see God walking with a two-step, trying to avoid stepping in excrement that's scattered all over the place. That’s a very visual picture. 

But what he is teaching here is the importance of the government being involved and helping to establish societal norms, structures, and systems that maintain hygiene, that promote health. And those are important things. This is an area where it's appropriate to relieve yourself. This is not an area and this is how you do it. And those things are good. We need government to help in these areas. 

**Government Sphere 45: Rulers Act to Address Health Problems.**  
I'm gonna read selections from 1 Samuel 5:6-6:18. This is a situation when the Philistines had conquered the Israelites and they had stolen the ark of the covenant, but the ark of the covenant was producing plagues in the, in the Philistine villages. And as a judgment, because they were not to have done this. And so this is what happens.

Then the LORD’s heavy hand struck the people of Ashdod and the nearby villages with a plague of tumors. When the people realized what was happening, they cried out, “We can’t keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer\! He is against us\! We will all be destroyed along with Dagon, our god.” So they called together the rulers of the Philistine towns and asked, “What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?” 

So government leaders are called in, what do we do? “Please send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its own country, or it will kill us all.” Is their demand. For the deadly plague from God had already begun, and great fear was sweeping across the town. Those who didn’t die were afflicted with tumors; and the cry from the town rose to heaven…Then the Philistines called in their priests and diviners and asked them, “What should we do about the Ark of the LORD? Tell us how to return it to its own country.”

So the citizens call the government leaders, the government leaders consult with their religious leaders. This is all among the Philistines, all the pagans. 

“Send the Ark of the God of Israel back with a gift,” they were told. “Send a gift offering so the plague will stop. Then, if you are healed, you will know it was his hand that caused the plague.” …And they were told, “Since the plague has struck both you and your five rulers, make five gold tumors and five gold rats, just like those that have ravaged your land. Make these things to show honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop afflicting you, your gods, and your land.

This is all, you know these pagan priests, the priests of Dagon, are trying to figure out, maybe this will work.

Put the Ark of the LORD on the cart, and beside it place a chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors you are sending as a guilt offering… So these instructions were carried out… Then the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors were placed on the cart. …went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh…The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they saw the Ark, they were overjoyed\! 

So this is the frontier Israelite town closest to the Philistine border. 

Many sacrifices and burnt offerings were offered to the LORD that day by the people of Beth-shemesh. The five Philistine rulers watched all this and then returned to Ekron that same day…The large rock at Beth-shemesh, where they set the Ark of the LORD, still stands in the field of Joshua as a witness to what happened there.

So as part of their responsibility to protect citizens, to safeguard justice and protect citizens, government should act and respond to society impacting plagues. And they don't always know what to do. So they should consult with the appropriate people. In this situation, they consulted with their religious leaders. They need to understand why is this happening and what is the solution? They got it right. And every government doesn't always understand why a plague happens and how to solve it, but that should be the purpose \- to seek understanding from God as to the real reason of the spread of the illness and to take action. That is of paramount importance, because that's an essential part of the governmental oversight of protection of its citizenship.

**Government Sphere 46: The King Defers to the Prophet.**   
2 Kings 5:1-14. Again, this is a long passage. So I'm just do selections of this. But in this passage, like the earlier ones, we see the problem of health being brought to the king and the king doesn't have an answer in himself, but as he brings in the prophet, that participation of the religious and the government spheres collaborating, we see a great solution. So the king Aram, remember that this was the king that a couple passages back had tried to send commanders to wipe out Samaria. 

…he had great admiration for Naman, the commander of his army because through him, the Lord had given Aram great victories, but though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy. At this time the Armenian raiders had invaded the land of Israel and among their captives was a young girl that had been given to Naaman's wife as a maid. One day, the girl said to her mistress, I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy. 

So Naaman told the king what the young girl from Israel had said. Go and visit the prophet, the king of Aram told him I will send a letter of introduction for you to take to the king of Israel. 

Remember these are the guys who are fighting against each other. Now he is sending his chief of staff is his main commander and saying, “would you heal him?" Well, he doesn't want to heal him, he wants him dead most likely, and all the other soldiers. But he, this is a tense political situation. 

So Naman started out carrying as gifts, 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold and 10 sets of clothing. The letter to the king of Israel said with this letter, I present my servant Naaman. I want you to heal him of his leprosy. 

Now remember the young girl said, go to the prophet. Well, he passed the word onto the king and the king is talking to the other king and says, I want you to take care of this. But immediately this is beyond the capacity of the king to do by himself. 

When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and said, am I God that I can give life and take it away?

You see having leprosy was like a death sentence, like hearing today that you have cancer, like you're expecting, unless there's some miraculous intervention that your time on earth is limited. 

Why is this man asking me to heal someone with leprosy? I can see that he's just trying to pick a fight with me. Like I'm gonna do something. And the whole army of Aram is gonna be on my border again. But when Elisha, the man of God, \[the guy who turns whole armies blind and sets up a feast for them\] heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes in dismay. He sent this message to him. Why are you so upset? Send Naaman to me. And he will learn that there's a true prophet here in Israel. 

So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and waited at the door of Elisha’s house. But Elisha sent a messenger out to him with this message, go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan river. Then your skin will be restored and you will be healed of your leprosy. But Naaman became angry and stalked away. I thought he would certainly come out to meet me..

you know, sense of importance. He's the chief commander of the army. 

I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call on the name of the Lord, his God, and heal me. Aren’t the rivers of Damascus, the Abama and Pharpar, better than any of the rivers of Israel? Why shouldn't I wash in them?…

He's all upset because of the expected protocol didn't happen. 

So Naaman turned away in a rage. But his officers tried to reason with him and said Sir, If that prophet had told you to do something very difficult, wouldn't you have done it? So you should certainly obey him when he said simply go and wash and be cured. So Naaman went down to the Jordan river, dipped himself seven times that as the man of God had instructed him and his skin became as healthy as the skin of a young child. And he was healed. 

Wow, you see in this story an amazing inter-play between personal need and governmental interactions from one nation to another. And, and with the religious sphere. The king understood his limits, the king of Samaria. He passed off the problem to the prophet and the desired solution came about. 

See, no one sphere can go it alone. When we have problems in society, problems that are beyond the capacity of any one of us, we need an integrated and collaborative approach. Now healthcare is a common concern of religion, family, government, and the economic spheres. We talk about healthcare in each one of those four spheres, because all contribute, all should be involved in the maintaining of the life and the health of the people. We need to do this together. We need to value the contribution that each sphere brings so that all people can walk in health and thrive as God intends them to. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
We're now ready to look at the six final passages that we look at the crossover between government and each of the other six spheres. In these we'll see how they collaborated well together or how they failed to collaborate well together, and the consequences of each. 

**Government Sphere 47: Government and Family.**   
We take this story from 2 Samuel 11:2-27. Again, because it's a longer passage I will summarize some of this. Many would know this passage. It was, David was king and he was staying in his palace and he looked out over the city and he noticed a woman of unusual beauty, taking a bath, looking through his rooftop, observed this. And he goes and sends one of his underlings to go and fetch her and, and invites her to the palace. Her name was Bathsheba, and he has sex with her, they have an adulterous relationship. Come to find out a few months later, she discovers that she was pregnant. The problem is that her husband, Uriah the Hittite, is one of David's mighty men. He is one of his close associates, one of the leaders in his army. And while David's been in the palace, he's been out on the field at war. And so it's obvious that her pregnancy is not due to her husband's interaction with her, but to someone else's. So after doing, committing adultery, David plots how to murder his friend, Uriah. 

Then David sent word to Joab the commander of the army: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing.

Then he told Uriah, “Go on home and relax. ” David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. But Uriah didn’t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king’s palace guard.

And he didn't. He went on to explain to the king, when King's David said, why didn't you go home? He says, how could I enjoy the pleasure of my wife when my colleagues are risking their life on the battle front? He had an integrity that David didn't have. And so finally he goes back to the battlefield and David sends a letter to Joab the command of the army and said,

“Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed.” So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy’s strongest men were fighting. And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers…When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the LORD was displeased with what David had done.

Certainly he was. David in this instance violated the law of the king. He committed adultery with the 10 commandments. He committed murder by proxy, but it was at his command that not only Uriah, but several others lost their lives. And, and he did so because he could, he had the power. He could command Bathsheba to come to the palace when her husband was gone. He could command Joab up to set Uriah up for a certain death. 

David used his position as king abusively. He abused his power. It was authoritarian and hedonistic what he had done, two of the, of the three things that were prohibited in that law of the king. He did that to obtain what was not appropriately his, to have the pleasurable sexual experience with Uriah’s wife. 

Government power does not authorize you to commit adultery and murder. David later repents of this in Psalm 51 and reading this passage is shows you how deeply God had to work in his heart to bring about a profound change and restore him to a place of right relationship with God and his neighbors.

Just because one has governmental power and can command things that he ought not to command does not mean that he should. He should exercise self control. Adultery and murder are not acceptable. Whether you're a king or an ordinary person, don't do it. 

**Government Sphere 48: Government and Economics.**   
1 Kings 12:4-18 is really a follow up on our passage. Government Sphere 24,  where we talked about Solomon and how he multiplied not only horses and wives, but he multiplied gold. And in the gold area alone, he had 666 talents of gold, over $14 billion worth of gold in taxes every year. Plus everything else. Solomon has just died. And his son Rehoboam is ascending to the throne and people gather to him and they say this: Your father was a hard master. Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us. Then we will be your loyal subjects. Reheboam replied, give me three days to think this over… 

And so I'm gonna skip through this passage in a little bit, but consults with some wise older counselors, they say, they're absolutely right. It's a legitimate request that they have. Lower the taxes, back off on the labor demands that you have. But then he asked his friends who grew up in the palace with him and they said, no, you don't want to diminish your lifestyle, keep it up, increase it even. 

So, Rehoboam decided to take the council of his friends, the younger ones. And when the people came back after three days, he said, my father laid heavy burdens on you, but I'm gonna make them even heavier. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions. When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them, they responded, Down with the dynasty of David. We have no interest in the son of Jesse, back to your homes O Israel. 

And they left. 

So after they split, Rehoboam only had two tribes, a tribe of Judah and Benjamin. This was a great tragedy. And it was all because as a king, he had not learned for himself and had not seen in his father, the exercise of self control. If you have the power, you have to know how to limit yourself. When we consider Solomon's failure, he violated everything in the law of the Kings and Rehoboam followed in his father's footsteps. And misery was compounded upon misery and great was the destruction that happened. 

Self control, knowing how to say no to yourself, how to limit yourself, when you have the authority as a ruler, as a leader is one of the most important virtues to cultivate. The lack thereof can destroy you and your people. 

**Government Sphere 49: Government and Religion.**   
This is from 1 Samuel 13:7-14. So Israel was on the verge of war. Saul, who was king stayed at Gilgal, and his men were trembling with fear. 

They were facing the Philistine army. And Saul waited there seven days for Samuel, because Samuel, the prophet had instructed him earlier to wait for seven days, but Samuel still didn't come. Saul realized that his troops were rapidly slipping away. People was trying to abandon ship. They were trying to desert. So he demanded bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings. Because he was king, people obeyed him. This was not what he was supposed to do. Only the priest, only the prophet was supposed to offer the offerings. 

And Saul sacrificed the burnt offering himself. Just as Saul was finishing with the burnt offering, Samuel shows up. Saul went out to meet him and welcome him. But Samuel said, what is this you have done? Saul replied I saw my men scattering from me. You didn't arrive when you said you would, and the Philistines are at Micmash ready for battle. So I said, the Philistines are ready to march against us at Gilgal, and I haven't even asked the Lord for his help. So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself before you came.

If you're a leader and you feel compelled to do something that you know is not right. Stop. Don't do it. 

How foolish, Samuel exclaimed you have not kept the command of the Lord your God, that was given to you. Had you kept it The Lord would've established your kingdom over Israel forever, but now your kingdom must end for the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart. The Lord has already appointed him to be the leader of his people because you have not kept the Lord's command. 

Wow. That seems like a very, very harsh judgment. Unless we really understand what's going on. See God was looking for a man after his own heart. God has the most power and all authority in the universe. And God lives with extraordinary self control. He doesn't do everything he could be doing just because he's God. He holds back so that we have the freedom to make our choices and do our actions. And he respects us. God, he has power over his power. He has self control over his control. 

And if you don't learn that, that's how good leaders, true leaders, godly leaders, godlike leaders lead. If you don't do that, you cannot be trusted. If you're given power and you use it, unwisely, use it precipitously. You use it without any restraint, not keeping within the boundary of your domain. You will lose your authority. 

The issue here is the importance of understanding the scope and the domain of every authority. When you use authority to usurp the domain of another \- so he took on the role of the religious \- you lose your authority. That's why in our governments today we have executive and judicial and legislative branches. When one tries to do something that is outside of their domain, it violates things. We have other spheres of society besides government. Government  isn't supposed to do everything. There are certain things that government's supposed to do. Other things that religion is supposed to do. Other things that family is supposed to do. Other things, oh, everyone has their domain. 

And most interpersonal and most international conflicts can be traced back to some person or some nation usurping the domain or the authority of another, one party against another. It's not a small thing. If leaders are not capable of exercising self control and confining themselves to appropriate boundaries of their authority, they lose all legitimacy to rule. That's why good governments have constitutions that specify the limits of government so that everyone knows government can do up to here and no more. Stay within your boundaries if you want to rule as God rules. 

**Government Sphere 50: Government and Education.**   
This comes from Daniel 1:3-4. Then the king \[that’s Nebuchadnezzar in this case\] ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families who had been brought to Babylon as captives. Select only strong, healthy, and good looking young men, he said. Make sure that they're well-versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment and are suited to serve in the Royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon. 

And this is how we start the story of Daniel and his friends. And when they arrive as captives into the palace of Babylon, they're submitted to a whole educational curriculum. Now it's interesting that biblically, education lies normally within the domain of the individual and the family and is supported by the religious sphere because the church is the family of God. So it's an extension of the family. 

In the Bible we rarely see government having a role in education. This is the most obvious exception to that rule. And of course here, the government that is doing this is a government as an opposition to the people of God. It's a pagan government. And their curriculum is about the language and literature of Babylon. The language is okay. But the literature? my goodness, that was all about their mythology and their false gods and their idolatry. The government was pagan. And the education was trying to socialize them into thinking in ways that were contrary to God. That's not a good example. We don't want to imitate that. We don't want to have governments, secular governments, imposing curriculum that is forcing people to think like they think in their religious paradigms when there's not in conformity with the ways of God. Every sphere should function in its own area of responsibility in its own domain of authority. 

**Government Sphere 51: Government and Media/Communication.**   
I'm gonna summarize the story that we find in Joshua 9:3-27. As you've got this in your Bible, take time to read the whole thing, but it starts off saying this when the people of Gibbeon (this is one of the cities in the lands that, Joshua and Israelites were intending to conquer) heard that Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, they resorted to deception to save themselves. 

So the first thing you have to think, their communication plan is essentially false. The media, their story- is deceptive. It's misinformation, disinformation. They sent some ambassadors and they put on worn out patched sandals and ragged clothes. And the bread they took with them was dry and moldy. When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, “we have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us.” 

You know, they, it was a drama. It was a great theatrical presentation, but it was all untrue. And so they said, where do you come from? They don't give a clear answer. So we come from a very distant country And they check out the bread, the bread's old and stale looking and they take the word for it. 

So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the Lord. Joshua made it peace treaty with them and guarantee their safety and the leaders of the community, ratified their agreement with a binding oath. Three days after making the treaty, they learn that these people actually live nearby. The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached a town in three days. They didn't do a thorough investigation initially. It’s no good to investigate after you've already made a commitment. 

The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty. Yeah. I mean, didn't do the right thing. And so Joshua marches and there with his army and talks with them, but he's made a treaty. So he can't fight them because he would be losing all authority. His word would be null and void. So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them. But that day he made the Gibeonites the wood cutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the Lord, wherever the Lord would choose to build it. And that is what they do to this day. 

A poor governmental decision was made because the veracity of the communication was not dually verified. There was no investigation and there was no pursuit of God. You can do the due diligence and with a natural gifts and also spiritually be in tune, check out, listen to God. If you're a government leader, even your due diligence is often not enough. Listen to God, consulting him before decision was made. They were manipulated by a misinformation campaign by their would-be enemies. If you're gonna make a major decision as a government leader, don't be hasty. Before you make a treaty. Investigate thoroughly and then investigate some more to make sure you have all the right facts and then listen to God. Then you can make the decision. 

**Government Sphere 52: Government and Celebration.**   
This comes from Mark 6:21-28.  Herodias’s chance finally came on Herod’s birthday. He gave a party for his high government officials, army officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee. Then his daughter, also named Herodias, came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests. “Ask me for anything you like,” the king said to the girl, “and I will give it to you.” He even vowed, “I will give you whatever you ask, up to half my kingdom\!” She went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother told her, “Ask for the head of John the Baptist\!” So the girl hurried back to the king and told him, “I want the head of John the Baptist, right now, on a tray\!” Then the king deeply regretted what he had said; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests, he couldn’t refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John’s head and bring it to him. The soldier beheaded John in the prison, brought his head on a tray, and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.

It is never good to make governmental decisions when you are in a drunken state. Don’t do it at the party. When the emotions are high. When the entertainment has been captivating. When you’re spur of the moment decisions, responding emotionally to seductive stimuli, not a good time to make governmental decisions. Take a breath, let the moment pass. Ponder deeply. Then you can make the good decision. If you don't, someone's liable to lose their head. 



**Religion Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader  
	  
**Religion Sphere Introduction**  
As we look at the sphere of religion, we want to consider what this sphere is all about. God's purpose for this sphere is the extension of mercy and reconciliation between those who have had broken relationships \- with others and with God. Competing religious worldviews contend for the hearts of minds of men and women everywhere. Without falling into a contentious spirit, we are to enter this marketplace of religious ideas, and clearly display why the gospel of Christ is unique. In fact, the gospel is the only means of enduring grace. For it alone makes lasting reconciliation possible through God's sacrificial love displayed on the cross. 

Our first section, like in all of our spheres is God and how he wants to reveal his character and ways, teach us through this sphere. So we're gonna look at six passages on God in this sphere of religion.

**Religion Sphere 1: Jesus is our High Priest.**   
We read from Hebrews 2:16-18. We also know that the Son did not come to help angels; he came to help the descendants of Abraham. Therefore, it was necessary for him to be made in every aspect like us, his brothers and sisters, so that he could be our merciful and faithful High Priest before God. Then he could offer a sacrifice that would take away the sins of the people. Since he himself has gone through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested. 

When we look at the foundation of the Bible and particularly the scriptures from the Original Testament, the two main religious roles are that of priest and prophet. And they are complimentary gifts, but they're distinguished one from another in this way: the priest’s role was to speak to God on behalf of the people, the prophet's role was to speak to the people on behalf of God. And Jesus is the prophet-priest. He fits both roles perfectly. He comes as a mediator to speak to God on our behalf and speak to us on God's behalf. 

**Religion Sphere 2: Reconcile to Be Reconcilers.**   
We read from 2 Corinthians 5:18-20. And all of this is a gift from God who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, “Come back to God\!”

Reconciliation, restoration of broken relationships, being adopted and reunited into the family of God… That's what Jesus came to do. That's what's so wonderful and so unique about him. And he invites us into his ministry to be partners with him in this task of reconciliation.

**Religion Sphere 3: Jesus is God's Prophet.**   
John 6:14. When the people saw him do this miraculous sign, they exclaimed, “Surely he's the prophet we have been expecting\!” 

In Deuteronomy 18 God speaks to Moses and he promises that one day there's gonna be a prophet, not just one of many prophets, but really The Prophet. It's a, the language of the Messiah, the one who would most fully communicate God to human beings. And this prophet would be known because it says chapter 18, again of Deuteronomy, verse 22, his predictions will come true. It if the prophets predictions do not come true, you'll know that the Lord did not give that message. So when the miraculous happens, when people say, be healed and people are healed and what they speak about happens, you listen carefully. So when people saw the miracles that Jesus was doing, this must be The Prophet, the Messiah, the one that is promised, the one who will speak to us on God's behalf. And it was confirmed by these miraculous signs. 

This is very similar to what's in Mark 16:17, after Jesus gives the great commission and they go out and begin proclaiming the gospel. It says many accepted what they preached and proclaimed it and miraculous signs followed them. This is what we should expect from God. Because if God is powerful in his words, and when we speak his words like Jesus spoke his words, miraculous signs will follow. 

**Religion Sphere 4\. The Purpose of Prophecy.**   
1Corinthians 14:3 For one who prophesy, strengthens others, encourages them and comforts them. 

This is a great definition of the purpose of prophecy. Sometimes when we think of the prophet, we think of some scary man with disheveled hair, and a bony finger pointing, predicting something about the future. And at times prophecies are predictive, but more often than not, they're prescriptive. They're not telling you what will be. They're telling you what you should do. Prophets, another way to say this is that prophecy is more about forth-telling than it is about foretelling. Instead of talking about what will happen in the future is telling you how you should live your life right now. And prophet, a true prophet of God wants us to align our lives with God's life. Our will with God's will. Our words with God's words. Our actions with God's actions. Our heart with God's heart. When we do this, we're walking in the way that the prophet intends us to walk. 

**Religion Sphere 5: Jesus is our Intercessor**   
Hebrews 7:24-25. But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. Therefore he's able once and forever to save those who come to God through him, he lives forever to intercede with God on our behalf. 

The fact that Jesus lives forever and is forever at the right hand of God and is forever interceding for us that he's always championing our cause. He's always on our side. He's always for us. This is what gives us confidence that our salvation is not a temporary, fleeting, passing phenomenon, but a reality that will endure to the very end of time. He's championing our cause every single moment of every single day guaranteeing and eternal relational intimacy with us and the God the Father, God the Spirit and Himself, God the Son. 

**Religion Sphere 6: When There is No Intercessor**   
This particular passage just paired with the one that we just looked at about Jesus being our intercessor. This one is entitled When There is No Intercessor and it comes from Ezekiel 22:30-31. God says in this passage, I look for someone who might rebuild a wall of righteousness that guards the land. I search for someone to stand in the gap in the wall, so I wouldn't have to destroy the land, but I found no one. 

I found no one. 

So now I will pour out my fury on them, consuming them with the fire of my anger. I will heap on their heads the full penalty for all their sins. I, the sovereign Lord have spoken. 

This is one of the most tragic, most sorrowful passages in all of scripture. God, who is always compassionate and merciful looks for every opportunity to extend forgiveness, redemption and salvation. But as a loving God, he must also uphold justice and equity. And if there is not someone who stands in the gap and, and advocates for those who are guilty of wrongdoing, he is required to uphold justice, but he wants to extend mercy. On this occasion in Israel's history, there was not a single person who would come and stand before God and plead on behalf of the people. He said, if there had been one, just one person who stood in that gap, I would've saved them, but there wasn't that one person. So instead of showing them the mercy that I desired, I had to execute the judgment that was required. The good news is in the passage that we looked at in passage five, that now and forever Jesus is the intercessor who stands in the gap. The sorrow of this situation need never happen again because our God is always interceeding for us. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**	  
This section contains 11 passages, which highlight the marks of true and false religion. Not all religious activity on earth is in keeping with biblical truth. And so we need to look at that and evaluate that. So these passages will help us to understand God's ways of working through the religious sphere. 

**Religion Sphere 7: A New Covenant.**   
This is taken from Jeremiah 31:31-34, but this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my instructions deep within them and I'll write them on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people. And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying you should know the Lord. For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already, says the Lord. And I will forgive their wickedness and I will never again remember their sins. 

This new covenant, what God envisions, what true religion is really all about, Is inner transformation. It's something that happens within and works its way out, leading to external demonstration. Religion is never something external that you impose, habits, rituals, traditions, that you requirements that you try to do with the vain hope of achieving some kind of internal change. No, it's the other way around a change of heart. A change of mind, a change within that comes to evidence itself in the externals. 

Sometimes people think of religion as a list of obligations that I just need to obey. I need to fulfill. And if I obey it long enough and hard enough and diligently, then someday I'll be able say, ah, I love God. I'll feel those emotions and have that, that buzz inside, go, oh its wonderful. And if I can maintain that long enough someday, I'll be able to say, I'm a man of God. I'm a woman of God. I really know God. You try to obey in order to love in order to know. And that's just the opposite of what this new covenant is all about. It begins with knowing God. John 17:3 says that this is eternal life to know God and Jesus Christ whom He sent. 

Eternal life is not something that happens after death. Eternal life is this transformed inner experience that comes when you have relationships through intimacy with the living God and his son Jesus. And when we know God, it's impossible not to love him. Everything about the God of the Bible, the creator of the heavens of the earth, the redeemer of our souls is absolutely attractive and desirable. He's just and kind, and patient and good and, and wise and creative. Every thing about him is desirable. So if you really knowing what we is, it's, what's not to love about him? Everything is to love about him. And if you love him in John 14, several times, Jesus says this, if you love me. You will keep my commandments. So just the natural consequence. So instead of trying to obey, to love, to know \- get to know him, fall in love with him and you'll see obedience naturally follows. 

**Religion Sphere 8: True Religion. God First in All.**   
Hebrews 11:17-19, It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham who had received God's promises was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, even though God had told him, Isaac is the son through who your descendants will be counted. Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead. 

To make sense of this passage in the story of Abraham and Isaac, we need to go back to Genesis 18. This chapter is the longest conversation that Abraham has with God. And he's interceding on the behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah, a city that God needs to bring judgment, but as always, God is looking, how can I extend compassion? And so Abraham says, well, God, you wouldn't judge everybody if there were 50 of those everybodys were just and all the others were wicked. God says, right, well, what about 45? I wouldn't do it for 45\. 40? 30? 20? 10? And Abraham talks God down. And what he is doing in that process is he is discovering who God is. He's getting to know God. 

See the gods of his day, of the culture out of which he came, gods of the surrounding cultures were fickle, angry, bitter \- gods that you had continuously appease. If you didn't appease them, they'd do you in. They’d they throw lightning bolts at you. They'd destroy you. They were gods who loved motivating people through fear. This is not the God of the Bible. And every time that that Abraham says, well, what if there's five less or 10 less? God's response five times is I will not destroy. I will not destroy. I will not destroy. I will not destroy. I will not destroy. 

You see God was teaching him that he's not like the gods. God is a life giver, not a life taker. He's not like the angry, fickle unjust middle Eastern gods of the surrounding cultures. So when several chapters later in Genesis 22, God says, you're gonna take my, your son, your only son, the son that I promised you, your miracle son and sacrifice him. He did exactly what Hebrews says here. He reasoned, “well, God is not a life taker. He was not one who destroys life. He's one that gives life. I can trust God in this.” 

We also read in Romans 4:16-19. These insightful thoughts. …Abraham is the father of all who believe. That is what the scriptures meant when God told him I've made you the father of many nations… That's what the name Abraham means. His name was previously meant Abram, which meant respected father, but after almost a century of living, God said would change your name. You're not gonna be just a respected father, which must have been a shameful name for him to carry, because he would've snickered behind his back. Because he wasn't a father of anyone said, I am gonna make you father many nations. This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life. And creates new things out of nothing. Even when there was no reason for hope. Abraham kept hoping, believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God has said to him, that's how many descendants you will have. And Abraham's faith did not weaken… 

He trusted God that he would bring new life out of even nothing. So he trusted God with the life of his son. He knew that God, what he revealed about this life giving, life enhancing, life protecting, life covering, life anointing God was so good that he could make God first and his son and his family, his life, everything would work out just fine. Because God is so very trustworthy.

What Abraham discovered is important for us too. When we recognize and come to know our God for who he truly is, it is with joyous confidence that we can put Him first in every dimension of our life. If that's a struggle for you, perhaps you need to get to know God a little bit better. 

**Religion Sphere 9: The Greatest Sin \#1: Idolatry**  
There are two passages that we'll be looking at at the greatest sins mentioned in the Original Testament. And the first one, The Greatest Sin \#1 is Idolatry. And we're gonna read selections from 2 King's chapter 17. This is speaking of the time when Israel was carried away into captivity and ceased becoming a nation, the Northern kingdom ceased to exist. This disaster came upon the people of Israel because they worshipped other gods  \[because of idolatry\] they sinned against the Lord, their God who brought them safely out of Egypt… did followed the practices of the pagan nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of them… They built pagan shrines for themselves in all their towns, from the smallest outpost to the largest walled city. They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles at the top of every hill and under every green tree. They offered sacrifices on all the hilltops, just like the nations the Lord had driven from the land ahead of them. So the people of Israel had done many evil things, arousing the Lord's anger. Yes, they worshiped idols despite the Lord's specific and repeated warnings. 

Again and again, the Lord had sent his prophets and seers to warn both Israel and Judah: turn from all your evil ways. Obey my commands and decrees — the entire law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I gave you through my servants the prophets… 

But the Israelites would not listen…They worshiped worthless idols, so they became worthless themselves… They followed the example of the nations around them… and made two calves from metal. They set up an Asherah pole and worshipped Baal and all the forces of heaven. They even sacrificed their own sons and daughters in the fire. They consulted fortune tellers and practiced sorcery and sold themselves to evil, arousing the Lord's anger. 

Because the Lord was very angry with Israel, He swept them away from his presence… They did not turn from these sins until the Lord finally swept them away from his presence just as all the prophets had warned. So Israel was exiled from their land to Assyria where they remain to this day. 

So when you look at the 10 commandments, the first four of those commandments have to do with our vertical relationship with God, of how we love God. If we love anything more than we love God, we make that thing an idol. Anything that replaces God as your first love is destructive to your life and to our society. 

**Religion Sphere 10: Genuine Religion: Compassion and Holiness**   
from James 1:27, pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you. 

This passage contains two thoughts, holiness and compassion. Now sometimes we have distorted images of these two words. Sometimes people speak of holiness as something austere and harsh and, and yeah, rigid. And compassion is kind of a laissez-faire, anything goes, whatever you want to do, acceptance and boundary-less. And neither of those are what the Bible is talking about. God is both compassionate and holy. He's always motivated by mercy and always holding to a life giving standard of righteousness. He lives in the realm of compassionate holiness. That's holiness with no harshness or he, we could say he lives in the realm of holy compassion, mercy that is always within the bounds of biblical standards. It's not holiness or compassion. It's not either or \- it's both/and. That is true pure and genuine religion. 

**Religion Sphere 11: The Greatest Sin \#2: Injustice**  
**…i**s we're looking at The Greatest Sin \#2: Injustice.  In passage number nine, we looked at idolatry. This one is injustice, we read in Isaiah 58:1-12. These selections. Shout with the voice of trumpet blast, shout aloud. Don't be timid. Tell my people Israel their sins. Yet they act so pious. They come to the temple every day and seem delighted to learn all about me. They act like a righteous nation that would never abandon the laws of its God. They ask me to take action on their behalf, pretending they want to be near me. We have fasted before you, they say. Why aren't you impressed? We've been very hard on ourselves and you don't even notice it. 

I will tell you why, I respond. It’s because you are fasting to please yourselves. Even while you fast, you keep oppressing your workers…This kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me…Do you really think this will please The Lord? No\! This is the kind of fasting I want: Free. those who are wrongly imprisoned, lighten the burden of those who work for you. Let the oppressed go free and remove the chains that bind people. Share your food with the hungry and give shelter to the homeless. Give clothes to those who need them and do not hide from relatives who need your help… 

Then when you call the Lord will answer, yes, I am here, he will quickly reply. Remove the heavy yoke of oppression. Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors\! Feed the hungry and help those in trouble… 

While the second set of commandments, the last six commandments of the 10 commandments, are about our horizontal relationships, about how we love our neighbor. And injustice happens when we don't love our neighbor as ourselves. And so if we're not loving God, we're not loving our neighbor, we are committing idolatry or injustice. Have you ever tried to hide from relatives who need your help? It gets pretty particular. Have you ever driven by someone who's asking for food? Who's hungry? Oh, this is true religion- where we are really care about others as much as we care about ourselves, 

**Religion Sphere 12\. Moses Intercedes for Israel (and Egypt).**   
From Exodus 32:7-14. This is right after the Israelites had formed a golden calf and worshiped committing idolatry in the very process of all being saved by God. It violated this very important first command that we've already looked at in a previous passage.  The Lord told Moses quick, go down the mountain. Your people who you brought from the land Egypt have corrupted themselves… They have melted down gold and made a calf and they've bowed down and sacrificed to it. They’re saying these are your gods O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Now leave me alone so my first anger can lay against them and I will destroy them. But Moses tried to pacify the Lord, his God, oh Lord. He said, why are you so angry with your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt. 

It sounds like moms and dads talking about their kids. When the grades at school are great \- My son, my daughter. But there's a note from the principal's office, honey, your son, your daughter.. and God says, Moses, your kids, that the one that you brought out of Egypt, Moses, no God, your people, the ones that you brought out in Egypt, there's a reality and a humor and a vividness in this story that just smacks of genuineness. 

…Why are you so angry with your own people whom you brought from the land of Egypt with such great power and such a strong hand? Why let the Egyptians say their God rescued them with the evil intention of slaughtering them in the mountains and wiping them from the face of the earth? Turn away from your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you’ve threatened against your people. Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob… So the Lord changes mind about the terrible disaster he threatened to bring on his people. 

This is such a precious and beautiful passage. God changed his mind, but not his character, not the principles upon which he makes his decisions. As we see many times throughout the scriptures, God will always be just, but is looking for every opportunity in which he can justly display mercy. And if the conditions for mercy are met, he will quickly change the proclamation of judgment to extension of mercy. He's consistently does this throughout history. And so if we know God, we can pray and intercede and contribute to forming those conditions, which allow him to change the preferred judgment into restorative mercy. This is what God's desire is. 

This is why we are exhorted by James. To remember that in James 2:13, that mercy triumphs over judgment. The reason it's true for us and our actions with one another is because it's true in God. This is how he acts towards us. 

Now, something really important to notice that Moses intercession, he doesn't excuse the Israelites. He doesn't say, oh God, you're being too harsh. Really what they did wasn't so bad after all, it's just the first time, give him a break. He doesn't make excuses for sin. He recognizes that God is just in his assessment and the consequences that he says they deserve are the appropriate ones. His line of argument is something totally different. And we learned some great things about this, and God is right to judge them as he is, but he least his intercessions, is first, the impact on the Egyptians, the godless, the ones who don't know God, the pagans, they will see the judgment and they will misinterpret God's motives. They will say Moses argues, God took them out into the desert to kill them. He took them out to judge them. And that's not what God's intent was. His intent was to do them good, to bless them, to take them through the desert, into the promised land, to display mercy and compassion on them. And so God's character, though He would be just in doing what he would do would give a wrong impression to those who really did not understand the full picture. God said a legitimate, that's a legitimate reason. I will take that in consideration. And the other reason is an impact on their Israelites because God had made a promise of covenant to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, their forefathers that he would make them as numerous as the stars in the heaven and the sands of the sea. And if you just destroy them all, it would set back that promise generations and generations. 

And for those two reasons, for love of the Egyptians and for love of the Israelites, God listened to Moses and spared judgment and extended mercy and displayed what religion is really about as we come into his presence and intercede on the behalf of people for good. 

**Religion Sphere 13: God Looks at The Heart**   
1 Samuel 16:7, but the Lord said to Samuel don't judge by his appearance or height, for I rejected him. The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart. 

This story is when Samuel was trying to discover which one of the sons of Jesse God intended to be the next king of Israel. And he looked at the eldest and he looked tall and handsome but God said, no, it's not about these things. And he led him to David who was not even present at that time, but who was out in the field, caring for sheep. God knew David's heart. True religion is not about outward performance. True religion is about inner realities. The character of our heart, our internal responses to God. It's about intimacy within. That's what we're really about. 

**Religion Sphere 14: Inner Transformation Desired.**   
From 1 Samuel 15:22-23. We’re reading about Samuel's response to Saul who disobeyed God and took on a role that he should never have taken to sacrifice the sheep before going into battle. His disobedience displeased God. He stepped out of his domain of authority and he tries excuse himself, but it was a religious thing I did. But Samuel replied to him. What is more pleasing to the Lord? Your burnt offerings and sacrifices are your obedience to his voice. Listen, obedience is better than sacrifice and submission is better than offering the fat of rams. Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft. 

Some of these little like little white lies, these little small sins that we think is like, no big deal. It's like witchcraft. Anytime we don't hear and obey God, it is doing the things that are absolutely contrary to him and stubbornness is as bad as worshiping idols. So because you've rejected the command of the Lord, He has rejected you as king. 

This is serious business. We're called to listen to God to understand his word, to obey him. And as we walk in that life of submissive obedience, honoring him seeking to please him in our inner being. That's so much more important then all the outward show of religious activities, the pomp and circumstance of religious ritual. He wants your heart. He wants to see that change within. That's what makes the real difference. That that's true Religion. 

**Religion Sphere 15\. What is The Ultimate Good?**   
This comes from Micah 6:8. No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good, and this is what he requires of you: to do what is right, to love mercy, to walk humbly with your God. 

Some translations say to do justice, love mercy, walk humbly. You know, that's not my normal inclination. My inclination is to love justice and do mercy. I do mercy because I understand that if I don't forgive, I won't be forgiven. And so it's to my benefit. I'm sure you prayed the Lord's prayer, and it says, forgive us our sins (or our trespass or debts, depending on your tradition) as we forgive those who sin against us. You are making a contract with God every time you pray that. If I'm slow in forgiving other people, be slow in forgiving me. If I'm quick in forgiving other people, be quick in forgiving me. They go like, okay, I, I wanna be the person who forgives quickly, because I know I'm gonna need it. So I do mercy because I know it's needful. 

But when someone, I don't like having to do mercy, because it means someone's done something mean to me. If I have to forgive someone that they've been unkind or unjust or something's gone wrong. And when something mean happens towards me and then something goes wrong with that person, I'm kind of a little bit happy. I shouldn't be, but I kind of love justice. I go like, yes, that, that, that felt good. 

But you know what? That's not how it should be. And that's not how it is with God. See, he does justice, but he loves mercy. When we say that he does justice, it means that he never gives us, any one of us less than we deserve. We get what we deserve or better. Or when we say he loves mercy, he always is looking to give us better than we deserve. The only way I can walk like that, in that absolute, generous love that God asks for every person \- is if I walk with God, if I walk humbly with him, if I walk with an attitude of a learner, depending on him saying, teach me, shape me, mold me, make me like you, Lord, make my thoughts more like your thoughts, my attitudes, more like your attitudes, my words and my actions more like yours. I need you. And if we do that, he begins forming his character in us and we start learning how to do justice, but love, love mercy. 

**Religion Sphere 16: Repent\! Believe\! Follow\!**    
These three words you'll find in Mark 1:14-18. Let's read this. Later on after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God's Good News. The time promised by God has come at last\! he announced. The kingdom of God is near\! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News. 

One day when Jesus was walking along the shore, the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing the net into the water, for they fished for a living. Jesus called out to them, Come follow me. And I will show you how to fish for people\! And they left their nets… and followed him. 

The way Jesus introduces the gospel message is very different from how we often hear it today. Sometimes we present the gospel as we're trying to sell sweets in a candy store. You know, if you just buy this and we talk about all the promises and all the good things that we try to make it look glorious and beautiful. We speak of the benefits and the promises, but this is not what Jesus does. When he meets those who will be his first disciples, He lays the expectations out very clearly. If we're gonna participate with him in True religion, we have to change the way we think, change the way we make choices, change our worldview. This is what repent means. It means a 180 degree turn. The Greek word for this is **Mentenoia**, which is literally a change of mind. And that which we considered to be good because it was pleasurable or the sins and pursuits that we had and say, That is not good. And I'm aligning now my mind with God. That's what repentance is about. 

And then to believe, to trust God that we can't fix things by ourselves alone. We need help and he's willing to help us. He's willing to forgive us and change us and transform us. And, and we trust him. 

And the third it has to involve obedience. Repent. Believe. Follow. In other words, obey. You know, the only promise Jesus makes in his presentation of the gospel, in this opening passenger in Mark? Is that if we do those three things, if we repent, believe, and follow, if we obey? His promise is that he will change us. He'll transform us. 

The people he was speaking to were fishers of fish. And he says, by the time I'm finished with you, you're going to be fishers of men. You're gonna be different persons at the end of this process and journey with me than you are at at the outset of this process. And that's his commitment. He commits himself to you and to me to work in our lives, to change us, to shape his character in us so that he can accomplish his good purposes to us. Repent. Believe. Follow.

**Religion Sphere 17: Forgiven and Cleansed.**   
This comes from 1 John 1:5-9. And I love this passage. This has ministered to me so many times. I hope it encourages you. This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declared to you: God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God, but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth. But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other and the blood of Jesus, His son, cleanses us from all sin. 

If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us, our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. 

This is such an incredible promise. And friends, we all have things that we need to confess. And confess, this word in English literally means \- it comes from the root in Latin \- means to ‘say the same thing as’ to have our speech align identically with the speech of another; to agree with. 

Let me give you an example, perhaps I'm praying one morning and as I'm in my time with before God, he reminds me remember your conversation with George yesterday? And God says you lied. I kind of think about it said, oh, oh no, I, I didn't lie. I exaggerated said, no, you lied. Well, I stretched the truth a little bit. No, you lied. Well, it was had elements of truth and elements that were a little bit false. You lied. And, and I have not confessed my sin until my words match His. And I say, God, thank you for reminding me. I lied. I need to make that right. 

And see, the moment that I agree with his evaluation \- and we can confess good things about ourselves or bad things that we've done, whatever he has said \- when we align our words with His, that's confession. And we're confident of this, that when we confess our sins, when we align ourselves and say, I adopt your perspective. He instantly says, I forgive you. 

He's faithful. That means he's constantly, he's dependable. He's trustworthy. You can count on this. And he's just, he doesn't break rules of doing this. He's doing the right thing. So he's faithful and just to forgive us. 

But what I love about this is not that we're not just forgiven. He says he goes on to state and he will cleanse us from all wickedness, from all unrighteousness, from all the consequences of sin. Boy, do I need that\! And perhaps you need that too. Good news is not only that we're forgiven and guilt and shame are dealt with, but he, that cleansing, that change, that transformation is wonderful. He doesn't just forgive us and leave us in our current sorry state. He forgives us and begins to work in our midst. He doesn't leave us in our mess. He cleans up the mess so we can be practitioners of the truth as it said in this passage. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section as contains five passages, considering the Biblical Purpose of Religion. So lots of different religions in the world, we want to see what is uniquely biblical, what matches the word of God. 

**Religion Sphere 18: God Devises Ways to Bring Us Back.**   
This comes from 2 Samuel 14:14. All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.

That is such a lovely phrase. He devises ways to bring us back when we've been separated from him. And you know, we've all been separated from God. We've not walked in the original design for which he made us. But God has pursued us with his love and He’s intentionally devised a way; he didn't actually really stumble upon something and say, oh, here's some way I can fix it. No, he had to invent and create and develop this. Jesus is that way. His life, his death, his resurrection, his incarnation and his atonement. Everything that he is, God made fully human. Reconciling us to God. This is the way that he has made. He's devised a solution for all the problems we have created. In order so we can find our way back home, find our way back to right relationship with God. Find our way back to that place of adoption. Being included in the Trinitarian love of the Godhead with Father, Son and Holy Spirit, restored to family love once again. God devises a way. Fantastic. 

**Religion Sphere 19: Why? For Love or For Gain?**   
Job 1:1-2:10. Some selections from this initial part in the book of Job. There was once a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless —a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil. He had seven sons of three daughters. He owned 7,000 sheep, 3000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area…

One day, the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them… 

Then the Lord asked Satan, have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all of the earth. He is blameless — a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. Satan replied to the Lord,  Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God. You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper, everything he does. Look how rich he is\! But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face… 

One day… a messenger arrived at Job's home with this news… the Sabeans raided and stole all the animals and killed all the farm hands… The fire of God has burned up your sheep and all the shepherds… bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants… The house collapsed and all your children are dead. I'm the only one who escaped to tell you. 

Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head, and fell to the ground to worship… Praise the name of the Lord. In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God. 

One day, the members of the heavenly court came again to present themselves before the Lord and the Accuser, Satan, came with them. …Then the Lord asked Satan, have you noticed my servant, Job? He's the finest man in all the earth. He's blameless \- a man of complete integrity. He fears God and he stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you angered me to harm him without cause. Satan replied to the Lord, Skin for skin\! A man will give up in everything he has to save his life. But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face… So Satan …struck Job, with terrible boils from head to foot… 

…in all this, Job said nothing wrong. 

Now Job is the oldest book, we are told, in the Bible. He would've been a contemporary from similar culture, similar timeframe as Abraham. And this book deals with some of the most basic and universal questions that human beings have about God, life, suffering, justice, and why we do what we do. 

But there's something special about this book. When we read this tale, we have an advantage over Job. You see, he didn't see what happened in that meeting in the heavenly court, but we do. We know what's going on behind the scenes. We get a telling glimpse of the discussion between God and Satan. This gives us insight as to what is really at play. Satan challenges God saying, in essence this: your kingdom and my kingdom are essentially the same. People follow me because of what I give them. People follow you because the blessings you give them. Job, doesn't really love you. He serves you just for what he gets from you. Take away the blessings and he will no longer worship you. He will curse you. 

That was the challenge. This is not a challenge of power. It's not something that God could just, you know, put his thumb down and squish, you know, the opposition. Do people love God for who God is? Why do they follow him? Is it for gain or for love? It really is not an issue of the justice of God or the power of God or the love of God. These are usually the ways that we frame the discussion around Job. 

The issue is why do you serve God? What is the motive behind your action? Why religion? Is it for selfish reasons in order to get the divine blessings? Or is it because you actually love God for who he is, for himself? 

Satan declares that Job serves God only for the blessings. God says Job does what he does out of love. And so the gauntlet is thrown down. The challenge is made and what's on trial is the motivation of Job's heart. Will he love God just for who he is? Even when all the divine blessings are taken away? And note it was Satan that takes them away. Not God. If he doesn't, then there's really no difference between the two kingdoms. A cosmic contest plays out and when Job loses all and still praises God, there must have been shouts of victory among all the angels in heaven. Job is who he is and does what he does motivated purely by his love for God. Not for what he gets from God. This is true religion. This is what it's really about. 

**Religion Sphere 20\. Personal Revelation of God.**   
Job 42:5-6. I had only heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes. I take back everything I said, I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance. 

In our previous passage, we would be looked at the beginning of the story with Job and this contest between God and satan and the motive of Job's heart. Job suffered greatly during this time. He lost everything, all his wealth, all of his riches, all of his houses, all his children. 

Obviously when you go through rough times, you ask a lot of questions. Job asked 125 questions. And his friends have to listen to him for a while, they try to silence him. They try to tell him to shut up. You have no justification. Certainly you've done something wrong. You deserve this. This is genuinely from God. Finally, they give up with him because he's still unsatisfied with their attempts and answers and the questions going go unanswered and God shows up. 

And when God shows up, he doesn't go. Well, question one, here's answer one. Question two. answer two. God does something very surprising. He starts asking Job questions. He actually asked him 75 questions. And so almost as God comes along with the side and says, Job, great job in your questions, but don't stop there. There's more to think about. Have you considered this? how about that? And he joins Job in this discovery process and tries to encourage him on and pressing in and pressing on. 

See Job, like many of us, like all of us, had a lot of secondhand information about God. You pick up all kind of thoughts or images about God from television and movies and sermons and Sunday schools and friends and school and, and whatever. Some of those things are true and some are not. How you sift that out? How you know what's really true about God? But through this difficult experience, all of those false concepts were being challenged and he was able to divest himself of those things. And he had an experiential encounter with the living God. He gets a fresh revelation of God, not based on hearsay, but on a personal face to face encounter with God himself. 

See, when we talk about real religion, it's not a, the goal is not to accumulate a lot of facts and information about God. It's not abstract knowledge, cleverly devised theology, checking all the boxes and getting things right. The purpose is a transformational encounter, a personal knowledge of God, meeting with him and knowing him on a personal basis. 

**Religion Sphere 21: God's Heart Longing Expressed.**   
This comes from Psalm 81:13-16. Oh, that my people would listen to me. Oh that Israel would follow me walking in my paths\! how quickly I would then subdue their enemies, how soon my hands would be upon their foes. Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him; they would be doomed forever. But I would feed you with the finest wheat. I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock. 

As we read this passage, we can hear the heart cry of God. It's almost a say, oh, oh, that they would do this. Oh\! This is his longing, his desire. Sometimes we think of God's will as something very static and calculated. It's filled with emotion. It's filled with the longing to bless us to do good to us, to help us overcome our enemies. This reason he expresses this is our sins and our disobedience, our distancing ourselves from him frustrate his good plans for us. He can't do all the good things he would love to do for us. The heart of God is one of blessing. If we would just, if we would just listen, if we would just follow, Oh, the things that you would do. 

**Religion Sphere 22: Repentance and Forgiveness of Sins**   
Luke 24:47. It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name, to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem. There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent. 

The great commission is repeated in each of the four gospels and the beginning of Acts. And each has a little bit of different emphasis. Mark tells us to preach to everyone. Matthew tells us to disciple all the nations. John reminds us that we're being sent out in the same way, by Jesus, as Jesus was sent out by the Father. But here in Luke, in his version of the great commission, he actually gives us the content of the message that is to be preached. And the message is this, there is forgiveness of sins for all who repent. And so two important truths can be drawn from this. One. It's our job to repent. Two it's God's job to forgive. That's it. When we repent, he forgives. That’s the Good News. That's the gospel. If we do the former, he will do the latter. You can count on it. Good News. Preach it. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section is about two streams, the mobile and local expressions of the church. And we'll look at five passages and together we'll consider how throughout the scriptures and history, there have always been two stream of religious service. Both of which are designed by God and are anointed by God. The technical terms that they are known as the sodality and the modality. But let's say that a little more easily. It's the mobile and local expression of God's ministry and people 

In the Original Testament this was depicted by the prophet who was mobile. They would go from city to city and, and proclaim the word of Lord. And we know the true prophets and there were false prophets, but God's design was that people would speak the word of God in his name, wherever He called him to go. And besides the prophet there was the priest. And there was sometimes good priests and sometimes bad priests, but they stayed in the location where the tabernacle was in earlier history and later at the place of the temple. When they worked together, prophets and priests \-like in the generation where Zechariah and Haggai, the prophets, worked together with Ezra, the priest, good things, in fact great things happened. 

That same pairing of these two streams we also see the New Testament, where the mobile expression of the church is led by Paul and his missionary band. And the local expression is led by James and the elders in Jerusalem. In pre-reformation history these two streams were expressed by those serving in the Catholic orders, the mobile church, and by the parish priests, the local church. So let's consider what the Bible have to say about these things. 

**Religion Sphere 23 Declare His Glory Among the Nations**   
Psalm 96:1-6, sing a new song to the Lord. Let the whole earth sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord, praise his name. Each day proclaim the good news that he saves. Publish his glorious needs among the nations. Tell everyone about the amazing things He does. Great is the Lord. He is most worthy of praise. He is to be feared above all gods. The gods of other nations are mere idols, but the Lord made the heavens. Honor and majesty surround him. strength and beauty fill his sanctuary. 

When we think of these two streams, these two functions of the church, the local and the mobile, the point is everyone needs to be involved in spreading the good news that he saves. He is the true God, the living God, the creator God, the Redeemer God. And when you look at this passage, you see that there's not a lot of difference really, between evangelism and worship. There are two sides of the same coin. When we worship God, we're proclaiming his glorious deeds to him. When we're doing evangelism were proclaiming his glorious deeds to others. It's the same thought, but one is directed in gratitude towards Him, and the other is directed towards others as an invitation to come and participate in the privilege of having relationship with this remarkable God. Worship is vertical. Evangelism is horizontal, but all of it must be driven by a daily passion to make his glorious deeds known. 

**Religion Sphere 24: Paul's Missionary Team**   
Acts 20:4. This happens during his third missionary journey. Several men were traveling with \[Paul\]. They were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. 

Paul was a team player and included a diverse group of people among his colleagues. Those mentioned in this passage, accompanied him on the third missionary journey, but there are only some of the many colleagues and coworkers with whom he collaborated in spreading the good news. Throughout the book of Acts and in Paul’s letters, there are 39 named individuals that are identified as being his coworkers. They come from different provinces and include both Jewish and Gentile background believers. They come from different economic context and their names indicate that more than a quarter of them, at least 10 or 11 were women. There was room for everyone on his missionary team. 

**Religion Sphere 25: Paul's Ministry Described**   
Colossians 1:28-29. So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God perfect in the relationship to Christ. That's why I work and struggle so hard depending on Christ mighty power that works within me. 

Paul here states the goal of his ministry. He uses a Greek phrase three times, **xxxxxxxxxx**, which means every human being or all human beings. He does this three times and each time with a different action. He warns every human being. He teaches every human being and he presents every human being to God. It's a rhythm that's intentionally repeated in the Greek, say, this is my big picture of you. This is my global vision. This is for everyone. I warn and teach and present. He does so with great intensity and focus, there is purpose and clarity of objective. He's got a clear vision, a mission statement that's driving his every action. This is a life of a true leader within the mobile stream of the church. He's fully committed to extending the kingdom of God everywhere, where it currently is not. He wants to say, go to places is never gone before and touch every single person on earth. 

**Religion Sphere 26: Levites Called to Serve the Tabernacle.**   
Numbers 1:48-53.   For the Lord had said to Moses, …put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with all its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings as you travel, and they must take care of it and camp around it. Whenever it is time for the tabernacle to move, the Levites will take it down. And when it is time to stop, they will set it up again… Each tribe of Israel will camp in a designated area with its own family banner, but the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant… The Levites are responsible to stand guard around the Tabernacle. 

Their ministry, the ministry of these Levites was focused on one location \- wherever the tabernacle was. At a later time it would be wherever the Temple was in Jerusalem. Their role was to care for the place where God gathered with his people. It was a place where those who loved God would congregate, to meet with God, to do their sacrifices, to receive forgiveness and to experience the grace of God. There was a lot of work that was needed to maintain this place and make sure it served its functions and in a place of meeting with God. Their calling was very specific and this calling is still applied in many ways throughout the body of Christ today, as people called to a particular location, serve there, day in day out, week after week, year after year, making sure that people can come and meet with God. 

**Religion Sphere 27: James Leads the Church in Jerusalem.**   
This is taken from Acts 15:13-22.. When they had finished James stood and said, brothers listen to me. Peter has told you about the time God first visited the Gentiles to take from them of people for himself. And this conversion of Gentiles is exactly what the prophets predicted… And so my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from eating food offered to idols, from sexual immorality, from eating the meat of strangled animals, and from consuming blood. For these laws of Moses have been preached in Jewish synagogues and city on every Sabbath for many generations. 

Then the apostles and elders together with a whole church in Jerusalem chose delegates, and they sent them to Antioch and Syria with Paul and Barnabas to report on this decision… 

Acts 15 is a pivotal moment in the history of the early church. It is known as the council of Jerusalem. At was at this time that the church came together because they had to make some important decisions. And so they came together \- leaders from the mobile stream of the church, that's Paul and Barnabas, and from the local expression of the church, Peter and James, together with other leaders to address the issues facing them and make decisions on matters of faith and practice. Because they collaborated together in a godly way, agreement was found. And together it facilitated a great multiplication of the church at that time in that generation. This is what should happen in every generation. People from the mobile and local church coming together, considering how can we do things? How can we communicate? How we can make the decisions that would advance the growth of the gospel everywhere we go around the world. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section has to do with the role of religious leaders. We will look at many particular aspects of this over the next nine passages. We'll learn about God's high standard for those who are called into this form of Ministry. 

**Religion Sphere 28: Doing God's Thing, God's Way.**   
1 Chronicles 15:12-13 says this. David said to them, the Levites… “You are the leaders of the Levite families. You must purify yourselves and all your fellow Levites, so you can bring the Ark of the Lord …Because you Levites did not carry the Ark the first time, the anger of the Lord our God burst out against us. We failed to ask God how to move it properly. 

That last phrase is the key one. Sometimes we get an understanding of about what God wants it to do, and we don't take time to ask him, how do you want us to do it? And we take off under our own power, with our own ideas, with our own initiative. And when we try to do God's thing, our way, we fail. In this situation with David people died, The plans were thwarted. There was a setback. Everything was delayed because they did not ask the question. ‘God, how do you want this done?” Is not enough to know that what of God's will. We must also know always the how of God's will.  Godly leaders. 

Godly leaders, press into God and ask all the right questions. What do you want me to do? How do you want me to do it? When, how, with whom and everything else that might pertain to that decision. We don't want to just get a blueprint from God and say, thank you and take off on our own. We want to develop everything that we do in clear partnership and deep fellowship and close intimacy with God walking with him, depending upon him listening to him and obeying in detail.

**Religion Sphere 29: The Five-fold Gifts**   
as found in Ephesians 4:11-13. Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son, that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. 

There's several places in the Bible that have list of gifts, different ministries. And I always was confused. Then one day I was thinking about this one in Ephesians four. it has one of the shortest lists. I thought, ah, just five, five gifts, some, Hey, I've got five fingers. And I thought these gifts correspond to those five fingers. The first one is like the apostle. The apostle is a Jack of all trades, a master of none. We kind of tend to think of it as a very high lofty gift. It just means the pioneer or the first one to go. And when you're the first, you do a little bit of everything, just like the thumb can easily touch all of the other fingers? The apostle does a little prophetic, a little evangelistic, little pastor, a little bit of teacher. The other fingers don't touch each other so easily. I can make my little pinky touch my index finger, but I have to kind of help it. And it feels uncomfortable after awhile. But this with the thumb, I can do that very easily. 

The next finger is the prophet the one, it says, thus says the Lord, speaking about what's right and wrong in calling people to a high standard. The third gift in this list is the evangelist. That's the middle figure. Relax. I'm not gonna show it to you by itself. I want you to see it’s the central finger and the tallest, that's evangelism, which should always be the central task of the church and the main thing it does. The next gift. The next gift of the list is that about pastor and that's your ring finger. And pastor's concerned about long term relationships about continuity of fellowship, just like a wedding band speaks of a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman. Finally the last gift is that of the teacher that corresponds to the pinky because  this is the finger that is most suitable for this action — for cleaning out your ear from the wax so you can better hear the word of God. That's the function of a teacher. 

So the apostle, the prophet, the evangelist, the pastor, the teacher. All of these gifts are functioning within the body. We need this diversity. We need different perspectives, different contributions, different leadership styles and leadership emphasis. It should never be a one man show. But when these gifts are used rightly it is not these gifts alone that are the function of ministry. Paul says here their responsibility is to equip God's people so they do the work of the ministry. It's not that those up front and leadership of the church who carry these functions are the one to do all of the ministry. They're to enable the whole church, the whole body of Christ to participate in ministry, wherever they are, doing whatever they do in their various vocations as they're engaged in the spheres. We need to equip in the church so that all believers everywhere are ministering and advancing the kingdom of God. That's what this is about \- the whole church being served by these five gifts in order to see God's purposes established everywhere on earth. 

**Religion Sphere 30: Qualifications for Church Leadership.**   
This comes from Titus 1:5-9. I left you on the island of Crete Paul writes, so you could complete your work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you. An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife, and his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious. A church leader is a manager of God's household, so he must live a blameless life. He must not be arrogant or quick tempered; he must not be a heavy drinker, violent or dishonest with money. Rather, he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life. He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he'll be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong. 

Paul unpacks the qualifications for a leader of the church. In the opening phrase, he repeats one word, which is the foundation, the word blameless. That's the key thing. We have to work to be an example, a model to everyone else. 

And then he talks about three different categories. First of all, he talks about family relationships, how you live with your spouse, how you live with your children. If you can't manage your own household, how can you manage that household of God? The second thing he talks about are the character qualities of a leader. First, he mentions five things that a leader should avoid. These are really an expansion on the principles of Deuteronomy 17, how to a leader must exercise, self control in the areas of power, sex, and money. Or to make it a little broader of authoritarianism, hedonism and materialism. See, he mentions three of them in the area of power of authoritarianism. It seems like that's the biggest concern that we don't lord it over other people but to be servants to people. 

But then the second thing he does in this area of character qualities, he mentions six positive things that a leader should pursue. The first two about the leader’s love life. The two words that begin with the word, **the Greek word Philo. So Phils and PHAs and Phils** means to love strangers. It's hugely thought of as hospitality, but to love people who are not like you. In the context where Paul is writing it said if you want to be a leader of the body of Christ and you have come from a Jewish background, you need to be able to love people from a Gentile background. Or if you are from a Gentile background yourself, you need to be able to love people from a Jewish background. If you can't love people who are different from you, you're not qualified to be a leader in the body of Christ. 

And then the next word is like, but you have to be **Philxx**. You have to have to be a lover of good to be lover of strangers. But that, that doesn't mean everything goes, because there are standards. What is good? What is right? What is correct? You need to love those things. So you have to be a person of passion if you're gonna lead. You can't inspire and lead other people if you're lethargic and I don't care. You have to be passionate about what you do. Love is a passionate activity. The next four words are all about having that passion under self control. That just making sure it's tempered with wisdom. So talks about family talks about character qualities, five don'ts and six dos, and finally about skills and abilities. And he says you, the leader must be able to encourage and must be able to rebuke. 

Some of us like to encourage people. And we find it really hard to confront them. And we always like to say the nice happy thing. Others are just given to saying it like it is, pointing out what it's wrong. That's just the way it is. And it's hard for them to think about being an encouragement. If you going to be a leader in the body of Christ, you need to develop the skill of doing both. So be blameless, good relationships with your spouse and your children. Avoid wrong use of power, sex and money. Love passionately, and keep it under self control, encourage and rebuke. Those are the qualities of a leader in the body of Christ. 

**Religion Sphere 31: Disciplines of a Church Leader**   
taken from 2 Timothy 2:3-16.  Endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ, Jesus. Soldiers don't get tied up in the affairs of civilian life, for then they cannot please the officer who enlisted them. And athletes cannot win the prize unless they follow the rules. And hardworking farmers should be the first to enjoy the fruit of their labor. Think about what I'm saying. The Lord will help you understand all these things. 

Always remember that Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David was raised from the dead. This is the Good News I preach. And because I preach this Good News, I am suffering and I have been chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be changed. So I am willing to endure anything if it will bring salvation and the eternal glory in Christ Jesus, to those who God has chosen. 

This is a trustworthy saying, if we die with him, we'll also live with him. If we endure hardship, we will reign with him. If we deny him, he will deny us. If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful for He cannot deny who he is. 

Remind everyone about these things and command them in God's presence to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them. Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth. Avoid worthless, foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior. 

That passage is very clear. It's a high privilege and high expectations if you're gonna be a leader in the body of Christ. And you must embrace the discipline, you must embrace the cost. You must endure hardship. You must be imitators of Jesus and you need to stay focused on what God has called you to do. 

**Religion Sphere 32: Come. Go.**   
This is taken from Mark 3:14-15. Then he appointed 12 of them and called them his apostles. They were to accompany him and it was, he called them to be with him and he would send them out to preach, giving them authority to cast demons. 

In Mark 1:17 one of the first words that Jesus says to his aspiring would be disciples was the word, “Come, follow”. We get to Mark 16:15, the last word, the last command he gives to his disciples is “go and preach". Begins with coming, ends with going. Coming to know him, to have fellowship with him, to journey through life with him. Going to give other people the same opportunity that you've had to invite them into the privilege of fellowship with this incredible God man, Jesus Christ. 

And so when he comes to this passage he selects the first 12 and spends all night praying. He says, who do I want to be with me? And why do I want them? Why am I choosing them? These are the two things that are highlighted. One that they would be with them. Come have fellowship with me, get to know me. Let's hang out together. Let's love each other. Come. 

And secondly, go, go, and I'm gonna send you out. You're gonna preach. You're gonna heal. You're gonna cast out demons. You're gonna do the work of ministry and the things you've seen me do, you're going to do. Come, go, come, go. This is the essence of discipleship. And this is what leaders need to be calling people to do always more intimacy with God and more engagement in serving the needs of the world. That's that's the message of the gospel. That's what discipleship is all about. 

**Religion Sphere 33: Mobile Teams Teaching God's Word.**   
This comes from 2 Chronicles 17:7-10. In the third year of his reign Jehoshaphat \[King of Judah\] sent his officials to teach in all the towns of Judah…He also sent out the priests Elishama and Jehoram. They took copies of the Book of the Law of the LORD and traveled around through all the towns of Judah, teaching the people. Then the fear of the LORD fell over all the surrounding kingdoms so that no one of them wanted to declare war on Jehoshaphat

Wow. What a powerful thing. The king organized mobile teaching teams. They would go from town to town, village to village and teach from the scriptures the ways of God. This had a transformative impact on Judah. But it didn't stop there. This impact spilled over into the surrounding kingdoms. Kingdoms that would normally be trying to take advantage of war against Judah, they heard what was being said, and they were stunned, amazed, touched, transformed themselves. And peace was the result. Was rooted in the reverence for God and the understanding of his word that was being taught and spread abroad through these mobile teaching teams. Maybe we should take lessons from that experience and think about how we could apply that today. 

**Religion Sphere 34: Ministry of The Prophet.**   
This comes from 1 Samuel 12:19- 25\. Pray to the Lord, your God for us, or we will die\! They all said to Samuel. For now we have added to our sins by asking for a king. Don't be afraid, Samuel reassured them. You have certainly done wrong, but make sure now that you worship the Lord with all your heart, and don't turn your back on Him. Don't go back to worshiping worthless idols that cannot help or rescue you. They are totally useless. The Lord will not abandon his people because that would dishonor his great name. For it has pleased the Lord to make you his very own people. As for me, I will certainly not sin against the Lord by ending my prayers for you. And I will continue to teach you what is good and right, but be sure to fear the Lord and faithfully serve him. Think of all the wonderful things he's done for you. But if you continue to sin, you and your king will be swept away. 

This is a rich passage to read and think of all the different things that Samuel does as a prophet. He's, he's addressed their wrongdoing. As they come back and repent and, and express their sorrow, he reassures them. He gives them hope. He speaks of forgiveness. So he who spoke words of correction is now able to speak words of affirmation, but then he goes on and teaches more, more about the character of God, more of what's expected of them. And he's personally committed to them. He's committed to pray for them. He reassures them, I am not gonna abandon you, and God's not going to abandon you. 

You can't speak the word of God in a corrective way to those for whom you're not deeply committed. It's out of the love for the people that you're ministering to and the life of prayer of intercession mediation on their behalf, that you have authority to speak corrective words. And that is something really important for all of us to remember. It's not just a role of proclamation of the word of God, but also an intercession, standing in a place of prayer on behalf of the people of God. That's what a prophet does, a real prophet.

**Religion Sphere 35: Prayer and Spiritual Warfare.**   
This comes from Ephesians 6;10-20. A final word: be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on all of God's armor so that you'll be able to stand firm against all the strategies of the devil. For we are not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. Therefore put on every piece of God's armor so you'll be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle, you'll still be standing firm. Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body of armor of God's righteousness. For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News, so that you'll be fully prepared. In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil. Put on salvation as your helmet and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 

Pray in the spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere. 

And pray for me too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God's mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike. I am in chains now, still preaching this message as God's ambassador. So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him as I should. 

These are the concluding words of the book of Ephesians. And some have described this book as sit walk, stand. The first couple chapters talk about how we are seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, who we've become as adopted sons and daughters of God because of the, this mighty work of redemption. And then you have a two and a half chapters, four or five part of six, that talk about how we should walk out our life. The consequences, the application five times it says, walk this way, walk this way, walk this way. And very practical living. Because of what he has done for us, this is what we should now do as those who have been transformed by him. 

Finally, we have this word stand. So we sit with Christ. We walk as he would have us walk and we stand in warfare against the enemy. Stand in a place of warfare, stand in a place of prayer. This is part of every Christian life. If you are not aware of the warfare, if you're not being diligent, putting on the helmet of salvation, taking the sword of faith, girding yourself up with, in these ways that are describing this passage, then you are vulnerable and you need to take a stand. Stand firm, do battle as God called you to do it. Not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual principalities in the place of prayer. 

**Religion Sphere 36: Not Without Your Presence.**   
Exodus 33:15-17. Then Moses said to God, if you don't personally go with us, don't make us leave this place. How will anyone know that you look favorably on me —on me and on your people \- if you don't go with us? For your presence among us sets your people and me apart from all the other peoples on earth. 

The Lord replied to Moses, I will indeed do what you've asked for. I will look favorably on you, and I know you by name. 

God's Emmanuel presence is the greatest good. It's the thing is to be treasured above all else. His presence is a sign of his favor that he's with us. It's our distinguishing mark. There's nothing that makes us more special or better than other people. As followers of Jesus the only thing that we had going in our favor is that we're not walking through life alone, but walking through life with him. And it's his presence, which is our great strength, our great confidence. It's his presence that protects us and guides us and leads us. It's his presence that transforms us. And it enables us to be the people of God, a uniquely distinguished people set apart from all the other people on earth. His presence is our distinguishing mark. Run hard after it, make sure that you and I, let us make sure that we don't do anything that would grieve his presence, that would cause him to want to go away. Let us always live with a heart and a hunger and a thirst for him. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
The next three passages in this section are really at the heart of the religious sphere. It's about God being with us, God, being at the center. This is the heart of the religious sphere, but not only of the religious sphere in every one of our spheres, we need to make sure that God is at the center of everything we do. 

**Religion Sphere 37: Named Jesus; Named Emmanuel.**   
Matthew 1:20-23. As he considered this \[this is Joseph, the husband of Mary\] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying Joseph, son of David the angel said, do not be afraid to do take Mary as your wife for the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit. And she will have a son and you are to name him Jesus for he will save his people from their sins. All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet. Look, the Virgin will conceive a child. She'll give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, which means God is with us. 

In this brief passage, in this encounter with the angel, and then the reflection on the ancient words of the prophet Isaiah, there are two names that are attached to the One who would be miraculously born from Mary. Jesus and Emmanuel. Emmanuel is about God's intimacy with us, that in Jesus, God was fully present and fully with us. And he journeys through life with us, experiencing life as we experience it. The Creator experiencing life as a creature. And he continues to offer this Emmanuel possibility to us. We can walk with him. 

The other name that he is given is Jesus. **Jeshua.** And the reason that he's given this name is a wonderful phrase that we often overlook says he will save his people from their sins. The name **Jeshua** or Joshua or Jesus is the name savior, but he says Jesus will save us from their sins. The Greek preposition for from is **apo.** And it means \- it's very graphic. It means to be distancing yourself and going away from it's like, you're going on a journey and you walk through \-out the door of your house and you walking away from the house. And with every step that you take you're going further and further away. It's not a static statement. It's a, it is a moving continuous action kind of preposition that you're going further and further away. So what Jesus does is he comes distance us from sin at ever greater degrees. It's not just that he saved us like by forgiving us, he's causing us to live our lives further and further and further and further away from sin. More like him, less like the way we used to live before we encountered him. What a wonderful, what a wonderful thing that is. This is a savior you and I desperately need. 

**Religion Sphere 38: The Purpose of Jesus’ Coming.**   
Mark 10:45. For even the Son of Man \[Jesus said\]  came not to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many. 

This passage is central, the key statement in the book of Mark. It declares the very essence, the reason for Jesus’ coming. But this is not the only statement of this kind. There are at least 60 different passages throughout the New Testament that state why Jesus came. He gives his purpose. They are phrases that begin with, like in order to, so that, for, and if you pay attention to those phrases, you can go through the New Testament and underline and highlight and consider all the various things that Jesus has done and why he came. It's rich and it's varied, but it's all rooted in this particular verse. This attitude of servant-heartedness. God comes and he addresses many needs. He heals us. He delivers us from the enemy. He upholds the law. He fulfills righteousness. There are many things that he says that he came to do. But it's because of his servant heartedness, that he's not thinking about himself and his own needs, but he's thinking about how he can care for us and our needs and how to heal our brokenness and restore our alienation and to redeem us from our sin. He comes to meet our needs. I don't know of any other God, in any other religious construct that is like this. All the other gods are desires that people serve them. Our God desires to serve us. What a remarkable God He is. 

**Religion Sphere 39: Two or Three Gathered in His Name,**   
Matthew 18:20. Jesus says for where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there among them. 

What a wonderful promise. Jesus calls a us to himself for fellowship with himself. He also calls us to one another, that together we're to enter into the fellowship of his presence. We're not a lot of Lone Rangers having a one on one relationship with God. With two or three committed to loving relationships, horizontally and vertically there's this wonderful communion that happens. This is what it’s all about. And he's at the center. When we gather he's at the center, he is the reason we gather he's the purpose we gather. He is the one who gives life and hope and strength and confidence and transformation. Don't you love him? 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
In this next section we're gonna be looking at four passages that describe the life of a Jesus follower. 

**Religion Sphere 40: Be Holy.**   
This comes from Leviticus 20:26. You must be holy because I, the Lord, am holy. I have set you apart from all other people to be my very own. 

Friends, we are called to be imitators of God. We're called to be holy because he is holy. We’re to be holy in the same way that He is holy. He has perfect knowledge and he perfectly lives up to all the knowledge he has. We have limited knowledge, but if we will do all that we know we're supposed to do, we're holy as He is holy. Not to the same degree, but in the same kind. 

But not only are we to be holy because he's holy, in Luke 6:36, it says where to be merciful because he's merciful. And in Matthew 6:12, it says we're to be forgiving because he's forgiving. And in Matthew 10:8, it says we're to be generous because he's generous. He's freely given to us. We're freely to give to others. And the list can go on and on. The more we discover about God \- who he is, his character and His nature, the wonderful attributes of this glorious God \- these things become a stimulus for our own growth and imitation. We’re to follow in his footsteps. That means everything that we discover about who he is, we need to ask him, by his grace to work those same realities into our lives. 

Revelation always proceeds transformation. The knowledge of God is really important in your own discipleship and growth as a Jesus follower. We must see him. We must see him afresh and anew and deeper and broader at every turn of our lives. We must keep our eyes focused on him. We must consider him as we read in Hebrews three. We must focus on him, as we read in Hebrews 12\. We need to passionately seek to run hard after him and get to know him ever more deeply, ever more whole-heartedly, ever more obediently. 

In 1 John 3:2-3 it says this: Dear friends we are all ready God's children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him \[Why?\] for we shall see him as he really is. And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure just as he is pure.  Will keep themselves holy, just as he is Holy, will keep themselves merciful just as he is merciful, Will keep themselves... You fill in the blanks. 

See, we know that we'll be like him for we as shall see him as he really is. When we are in his presence, when we really glimpse him and we say, oh, that is so wonderful. It's just such amazing that you are like this. How could we aspire to be otherwise? We want to align ourselves with our Glorious Lord. And so this revelation, this is the foundation for this breakthrough of transformation. So let's keep running hard after God, let's keep pursuing with our whole heart. Let's be holy as he is holy. 

**Religion Sphere 41: The Fruit of the Spirit**   
comes from Galatians 5:22-25. But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control. There is no law against these things\! 

Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucify them there. Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives. 

Friends, this is such a wonderful statement we’ve just read. Let’s follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives. Think about what you do in the area of religion or as you go about life in whatever sphere you're involved with, how are we a follower of Jesus? Are we pursuing as you're in your workplace, are you pursuing love in that part of your life? As you're talking with a neighbor, are you pursuing joy in that part of your life? As you're going to school and, and hanging out with friends, are you pursuing peace in that part of your life? As you're talking with your boss, are you pursuing patience in that part of your life? As you're talking, dealing with your children and having some challenges there perhaps, are you pursuing kindness in every part of that part of your life? See, every one of these attributes need to be evident in every part of our life. This is how the kingdom of God grows \- in us and through us in the world. And we only do this as he's at work in us. 

You know, you never see an apple tree in an orchard kind of groaning and struggling like fruit, Fruit, fruit. There's an apple, there's an apple. They just naturally do that because as the sap flows through the tree, that's what it does. As we let God flow through us, as we spend time in his presence, let him do his work. We don't change ourselves. We can inhibit change, but we can collaborate with the change that he's working in our lives so that his fruit it’s not just the fruit of the Spirit. It's not my fruit or your fruit. It's his fruit, emerges a reflection of his character, because he is perfect Love. He is perfect joy and peace and patience. He is goodness and kindness, his perfect faithfulness and gentleness. And he's extraordinary in his self control. May we allow all of these things to flourish in our lives more and more. 

**Religion Sphere 42: Declare the Excellences of Him.**   
1Peter 2:9-10. But you are not like that for you are chosen people. You are Royal priests, a holy nation, God's very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you had no identity as a people; now you are God's people. Once you received no mercy; now you have received God's mercy. 

Because of what God has done in our lives, we should all be proclaiming his goodness to others. Some translations talk about this as declaring the excellencies of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light. Excellencies of him. We need to talk about how wonderful our God is. Don't try to shove truth down people's throats that they're not wanting, but do talk about how amazing this God is at every turn at every opportunity. There's so much to say about him so much good, so much that is wonderful. And as we looked at a the previous passage, the connection between worship and evangelism is almost the same. They're so close. In worship we tell him that we think he's excellent and evangelism we tell others that we think he's excellent. 

Let me tell you a story. Some years ago, I was involved in leading that evangelism outreach in **Vegan Delma**, the main resort city in central coast of Chile. And we had been doing this for a couple years and we had quite a bit of success and there's a walking area in the evenings where many people gather in the middle of summer and so easy to set up and have some music and present some drama, share some testimonies and then talk with people about Jesus. And, we've been doing this successfully and we were feeling quite competent about it. And we'd seen people come to the Lord night after night. 

On this particular night we had a great program. And everything worked as well. But as we broke up and talked with people, not a single person got saved. And we went back to the place and where we were staying said, what happened, Lord? What was the matter? We felt like we had kind of forgotten what we were really doing. We had, we got the program down so well, we could kind of just do it on our own. And we remember that what we were supposed to be doing is talking about the excellences of him. 

So we determined it the next night to kind of correct our, our actions. We'd go not to that central place where people gather, but to a park where in the evenings almost no one was there and we would just worship him. And we'd just align our hearts once again with declaring his excellences. So we gathered in that park determined to just worship God that night. We were not about evangelism, not about the task of getting the gospel out to other people just wanted to worship him. 

And as we worshiped this place that never had anyone first, a handful gathered and then more and more, we just kept worshiping, just telling him how much he loved him, how wonderful he was. And we kept worshiping. And when we finished worshiping, a large crowd, many dozens of people had gathered around us. And they'd been sitting there for the longest time, just watching us. We didn't say anything to them. We didn't preach the gospel. We didn't do a drama. We were just worshiping. And when we finished, we just said, Thank you for being with us as we worship God, if you want to chat with us, feel free to do so. We broke up and dozens gave their life to the Lord that night. We just worshiped. We just talked about the excellences of Him. We just, we just spoke of His love with his mercy of his kindness. We reminded this is really what we're doing. When we can express our love for God in public, and it's genuine. It's real, it's attractive. It'll draw people. It'll make them say, I wanna know that God too. You've got something that I really want. That's what this passage in Peter's talking about. We have a great message. We have a marvelous God, let's not be afraid of speaking of his excellencies. 

**Religion Sphere 43: Imitate Jesus; Embrace Suffering.**   
1 Peter 2:21-25. For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for us, he is your example. And you must follow in his steps. He never sinned nor ever deceived anyone. He did not retaliate when he was insulted nor threatened revenge when he suffered. He left his case in the hands of God, who always judges fairly. He had personally carried our sins and his body on the cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By his wounds you are healed. Once you were like sheep and wandered away. But now you have turned to your Shepherd, the guardian of your souls. 

We're called to be imitators of Jesus. Not only when the good times, but in the hard times. Not only the hard times, but in the hardest of times when everything is going wrong, when perhaps we're being treated unjustly, perhaps even in times of persecution. We need to learn to suffer well, to endure well. That’s what Jesus did. It's easy to imitate when everything is going well. It's challenging to do well when things are hard. And that's what that's, when you really see is Jesus and his blood at work in your life. 

You know, when someone treats you unjustly, it's natural to want to react and they're mean to you and you want to be mean back to them and get even. But when the moment we do that, the moment we react to someone, we give them leadership in that relationship. So imagine if someone punches you in the nose and you react by punching them in the nose. What have you just done? You've sceeded to them the role of the ones who determining the direction the relationship is going in. You say you lead. You're mean I'll be mean. And you're submitting to them. What God calls us to do when we are as imitators of Jesus, who went to the Cross and was like a lamb before shearers who did not open his mouth, though he was being unjustly accused, He did not accuse anyone. If instead of reacting into moments of injustice, we learn to respond in the opposite spirit. Then something transformative happens. If someone punches you in the nose and instead of punching back in reaction, which is re \-action doing the same thing that they did again, giving them the leadership. You respond with the opposite spirit and we're to embrace them whether physically or metaphorically. You’ve just changed the whole dynamic of that relationship. You are now leading it. Jesus through his kindness, through his mercy, through his love, through his servant- heartedness changes the discourse of our relationships. He he's the one who, because he does this earns the title Lord of Lords, King of Kings. He leads. No longer do other people set the agenda. Jesus sets the agenda. If you respond in a Christlike manner, you maintain the leadership and the relationship and you exemplify the spirit of Christ. Let's imitate Jesus. Even if it means suffering. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
In this next section, we're gonna be looking at the sphere of religion and healthcare. And we've seen that this issue of healthcare is one that is shared by government and family and economics, as well as religion. And so it's very important because if the individual is not healthy, if they die, get sick and cease to exist \- everyone suffers. So every one of these spheres is concerned about the wellbeing of the individual. 

**Religion Sphere 44: Levitical Laws for Healthcare.**  
Selections from Leviticus 13:1-46. The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, if anyone has a swelling or rash or discolored skin that might develop into a serious skin disease, that person must be brought to Aaron, the priest or to one of his sons. The priest will examine the affected area of the skin… On the seventh day, the priest will make another examination… Anyone who develops a serious skin disease must go to the priest for an examination… If anyone has a boil on the skin that has started to heal… that person must go to the priest to be examined. If anyone has suffered a burn on the skin… the priest must examine it… If anyone, either man or woman has a sore on their head or chin, the priest must examine it…On the seventh day, he will examine the sore again… If anyone, either man or woman has shiny white patches on the skin, the priest must examine the affected area. 

It and goes on and on. All these various diseases, the priest must examine, he must evaluate. He sometimes quarantines them. The priests and the Levites that are supporting them are charged with the primary functions of healthcare. They're checking out the illnesses. They’re setting appropriate quarantines, they're evaluating. Is this something that's contagious? Or is this a, is it growing? Is it expanding? Should it be withdrawn from the community so others don't get it? Or is this, are, is it improving? They monitoring people until their health is fully restored. So we see that this was a function that God gave to leaders within the religious sphere. Religious leaders should be compassionate and concerned about the health of people. They should go do everything they can to contain illness and to facilitate wholeness. 

**Religion Sphere 45: Commissioned to Heal.**   
Matthew 10:1,8. Jesus called his 12 disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and illness… 

He said, heal the sick, raise the dead, cure those with leprosy, and cast out demons. Give as freely as you have received\! 

As Jesus followers, we are to step into this calling, the calling to heal, to care for other people on their place of need. And we can give to the degree that we've received that. It says freely you've received freely give. Perhaps we need to receive healing of every kind in order to be agents of healing, that gives us authority. There's something genuine. And we just facilitate that. We know that the healer is Jesus himself, but as his followers, we help build the bridge for that healing to happen. 

**Religion Sphere 46: Prayer Produces Wonderful Results.**   
This comes from James 5:13-16. Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises. Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick and the Lord will make you well. And if you've committed any sins, you'll be forgiven. 

Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results. 

Sometimes we are fearful about obeying these instructions in these passages. Because we think what if I pray and nothing happens? Well, you don't know that. All we're called to do is do what we've been asked to do. We pray. We pray earnestly, we pray in faith. We pray in the name of Jesus. We pray with others, and we do what we do. And we leave the results in God's hands. 

You know, there was a time when I was leading a, a ministry in South America and a colleague of mine had gotten typhoid fever and I went and prayed for him one day. And after I left, he got worse. The next day I came back and I said, can I pray for you again? He said, oh, please don't. That was a little bit discouraging at the time. But I kept praying and God heard this earnest prayer. It's not casual, One time prayer. There's no magic or trick. Or if I just do this, I'll manipulate God into answering this. We do what we do and We leave the results in God's hands. I can tell you stories of times when I prayed that and nothing seemingly happened, but many times I prayed and people's lives were touched. They were healed and they were changed. 

You know, let's change analogy right now. You know who the person who has made the most, uh, soccer penalties in history? It's **Leon L Messey**, You know, who's the one who's missed the most soccer penalties in history? **Leon L Messey**. It’s that \-you just have to keep going at it more and more times. And the more you do it, the more success you'll have. And \- The more times it just doesn’t it turn out, like, as you had hoped. You keep persevering, earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results. Friends, even when they're not, the prayer is not answered in the manner or the timeframe that you are expecting, God is doing things behind the scenes in your life, in their lives. And you just keep pressing in. Wonderful results are on the way. 

**CROSSOVER INTRODUCTION**  
As in every sphere, the last six passages are crossover passages, connecting religion with each of the other six spheres. Some of these examples show healthy ways that they collaborate together. Some of the examples show areas where the wrong kind of collaboration happened, and it was destructive. Ponder on these passages and consider the principles that you learn from them and how you might apply them in your context where you live today.

**Religion Sphere 47: Religion and Family**   
will be from Jeremiah 32:33-35. My people have turned their backs on me and have refused to return. \[God is speaking.\] Even though I diligently taught them, they would not receive instruction or obey. They have set up their abominable idols right in my own Temple, defiling it. They have built pagan shrines to Baal all in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they sacrificed sons and daughters to Molech. I've never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing. What an incredible evil causing Judah to sin so greatly. 

Here's where religion and family got really messed up. And God is grieved. Israel had turned to idolatry and they picked up the practices of pagan nations around them. And one of them was the worship of Molech.  Molech needed to be appeased. And if he was appropriately appeased, then you could guarantee victory in a battle or prosperity in a crop or some other request. 

But Molech demanded a very high price. He would only answer a request if you sacrificed one of your children. Imagine that. 

The idols, those stone idols of Molech were made out of granite. And, and the belly of this statue was a hollowed out stomach. And they placed a fire around it to heat the stone up until it was sizzling red hot, and then they take a newborn child and lay it in the hollow of that stomach. And the child would literally fry to death. You can imagine the flailing arms and the screams of despair. It was a horrible, horrible thing. It was like- it says here \- a horrible evil and incredible evil. What parent would do that for their child? They were religion was so mixed up that they thought they could make gods happy by destroying their own family. And God says it is just unthinkable. How could you ever think that a god would ask this? That I, I would, I would never have thought of even commanding or it's the detestable it’s horrid. 

Unthinkable, that we would kill the youngest in our society for personal convenience to gain something, to avoid something. It's horrible. We don't have Molech idols, but the young still perish. The most defenseless in our midst, the ones who don't have a voice to speak up for themselves. True religion is not like this. True religion protects the life of the little ones. True religion enhances family. Doesn't destroy family. True religion is what gives life. Not what brings death.

**Religion Sphere 48: Religion and Economics.**   
We're reading from Acts 8:18-23. When Simon \[not Simon Peter, another Simon\] saw the Spirit was given when apostles laid their hands on people, he offered them money to buy this power. Let me have this power too, he exclaimed, so that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit. 

But Peter replied, may your money be destroyed with you for thinking God's gift can be bought\! You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God. Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive your evil thoughts for, I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin. 

This man Simon saw genuine power and transformation through the hands of the apostles, and thought he could buy this. He thought that religion was for sale. That it was some kind of trick that you could manipulate. He thought this would be a good way to make a profit. You can't buy genuine faith. You can't sell biblical religion. You have to give it away freely and you have to hunger after it without a greedy heart and pursue it with a generous spirit.

**Religion Sphere 49: Religion and Government**   
the crossover passage between Religion and Government. We're gonna read from Judges 6:25-32. That night the Lord said to Gideon, take the second bull from your father's herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father's altar to Baal, and cast down the Asherah pole standing beside it. Then build an altar to the Lord you God here on this hilltop sanctuary, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down. 

So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father's household and the people of the town. 

Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been broken down and that Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. In their place of new altar had been built, and on it with the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed. The people said to each other who did this? And after asking around and making it careful search, they found that it was Gideon. The son of Joash. 

Bring out your son, the men of the town demanded of Joash. He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole. 

But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning. If Baal is truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar\!  From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means let Baal defend himself, because he broke down Baal's altar. 

So we have Gideon doing a bold religious act, confronting idolatry, not just in the town where he lived, but even in his father's household. It was a scary thing to do. He knew that it would insight the ire and anger of the people. That's why he did it at night. He was justifiably afraid. And when his deed was found out, people said, let's, let's execute him. A crime has been committed. Let's kill him. 

And his father, even though it was on his property, wisely said, listen, this is a religious activity, not a governmental one. If Baal is really god, Baal will take care of it himself. If he is not, why would you be risking your lives for something that is not a God? And so made this distinguishing between the religious sphere and the governmental sphere. No governmental action was to be taken against Gideon for the exercise of his religious beliefs. If a god can’t defend his own, he is not a god. And who would like to fight for such a non-god? 

**Religion Sphere 50: Religion and the sphere of Education.**   
Matthew 13:52, Jesus added Every teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old. 

If you're gonna be following Jesus and you're gonna be a teacher, you need to remain teachable. You're gonna be learning new things from him. So is that you've known in the past, that are true. And you keep using that, keep bringing that out of the storeroom, drawing on those old insights, but always embracing the new insights, the fresh things that he is giving. Teachers must be teachable. And if God is growing your understanding in the religious sphere, make sure you bring all of that into your teaching. 

**Religion Sphere 51: Religion and the sphere of Media/Communication**  
Romans 10:14-15. But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they've never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell him without being sent? That is why the scriptures say how beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news\! 

Communication is at the heart of the religious practice of evangelism. We can't spread the kingdom of God without media/communication. They work hand in hand. And so good communication Is like putting on beautiful sandals when you're going across the mountains. It helps you walk better. It keeps you from getting sores on the souls of your feet. You're protected. You can go further. Good communication and good religion go hand in hand together, to preach the good news of a good God in a world that needs to hear a lot more about good things.

**Religion Sphere 52: Religion in the sphere of Celebration**   
taken from 2 Chronicles 5:12-14 And the Levites who were musicians \- Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and brothers —were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals, lyres and harps. They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets. The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words;

“He is good\! His faithful love endures forever\!”

At that moment, a thick cloud filled the temple of the Lord. The priests cannot not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious of presence of the Lord, filled the Temple of God. 

When the spheres of celebration and religion align to worship God, amazing things happen. It must have been a beautiful spectacle. The fine linen… I mean, it was something lovely to behold and something delightful to listen to with all these instruments and all these choirs. But is the blending of these anointing of these two spheres that usher in the glorious presence of the Lord. It made such an impression that people were stunned. His presence was so great that everything came to a standstill and people stood in awe before the God Who was Present. That's what happens when the spheres collaborate around of the glory of God 



**Education Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader  
June 2023

**Education Sphere Introduction**  
We're now going to be speaking about the sphere of education. God has designed the educational sphere to be a means of discipleship and multiplication. The purpose should be the transformation of the student, rather than the mere transaction of knowledge. Godly education should develop biblical Christians who have Jesus as their model and the Bible as their foundation. This should occur in a family friendly context, for God has delegated to the family the primary authority and responsibility for the education of their children. Every family on earth should have access to a Christian school for their children.

We're going to start by looking at God in the sphere of education. And we'll look at six passages related to this theme.

**Education Sphere 1: God Longs to Reveal Himself Relationally.** 

Exodus 6:7. I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God, who has freed you from your oppression in Egypt.

God is a revealer of truth. He is not a hider of truth. He doesn't communicate in a way to confuse or distort, but to bring understanding and insight. We read in 2 Peter 1:3 ...God has given us everything we need for living a godly life... Everything we need, all the truth that is necessary. We don't have all the truth, but we have all that's necessary.

It's important to note that God reveals relationally. It's not a systematic revelation. You look at the Bible, it's not organized like a systematic theology would be organized. It's not even organized thematically. You can't just go and say, "I want to read the book on prayer," because there's prayer in almost every book. "I want to read the book on the character and nature of God." He's revealed all throughout the scriptures. So how does God reveal himself, if not systematically or thematically? He doesn't force us into a mold of a predetermined pre-established curriculum and say, "Everyone line up and do step one first and then step two and step three". He reveals himself in response to where people are \- to their situations, their circumstances, their needs, their fears, their challenges, their life.

In Genesis 17:1, God reveals himself to Abraham in a way that He'd never revealed himself to anyone else. He says "I'm **El Shaddai.**" He gives a new name, a new understanding of who He is. This word **El means God, and Shaddai** means all powerful or omnipotent or All Potent One. And why would God reveal himself like that to Abraham? Well, because God, the All Potent One was speaking to Abraham, the im-potent one. Abraham could not produce life. He could not bear a son. He could not have the child of his dreams. God had the power to bring forth life and sustain life and nurture life and make life flourish and is over everything in the whole universe, He has all capacity.

God was everything that Abraham was not. The word **Shadda**i comes from the Hebrew, the word is the **Chad**, which is the nursing breasts of a young mother. And just like the milk of a mother has everything that the child needs to sustain life and to grow and mature and develop, so God has everything to give us life. Wow. That’s a wonderful concept. God comes and says, "I Am who you are not. I have what you do not have, and as we partner together, as you trust Me, I will do My work in you." This is the exciting thing. God met him there. He didn't just have a big wheel of fortune and spin and say, "Which name am I going to reveal today. No. The curriculum for Abraham designed by Abraham's circumstances. What a thoughtful God\! What a caring God\! What a sensitive God\! What an amazing God\!

Um, let's think about Moses. What was Moses's big problem? There were several things going on in Moses life, but one of the things he had challenges with was anger. You might remember that he got angry at injustice against the fellow Jew, who was a Hebrew, who was a slave when he was just discovering his Jewish roots and he murdered an Egyptian. And that way he had to flee from Egypt and spent 40 years in the wilderness. 

He also got angry later on in his life, when after many years of leading the people of Israel through the desert, they once again ran out of water and this time, God says, "Speak to the rock." And in an earlier occasion God had said to strike the rock with his rod, but Moses wasn't paying attention to God. He was just frustrated. He was impatient. He was angry. He was upset with these people who were giving them headache after headache, after headache. So he took the rod and he struck the rock. And water came out. A miracle happened. The people were happy. But God was not pleased because he did not only obey God in detail. He acted out of frustration, out of anger rather than out of a gracious and loving obedience. 

It was a serious thing. Because of that he never entered the promised land. He died before all the Israelites were able to cross over. He never saw the dream fulfilled until many, many years later when Jesus walked the land. And on the Mount of transfiguration, Moses with Elijah and with Jesus in the Promised Land. What happened for Moses is true for all of us, the way we get to the promised land —because we've failed, we’ve disobeyed, we’ve done things as we ought not to have done that, the only way is when we meet Jesus and he takes us into the land. So the story of Moses is an important parallel for us.

But at one point in his life and chapter 34 of Exodus he's just really desperate. The people have disobeyed God. They’ve worshiped the golden calf and he just, he can say, "God, I just don't know how to go forward. I just need to have a fresh revelation of you. I just need to see you. I need to know you. I can't go on with, with a foundation of knowledge that I have. I need more intimacy." So he's hungry, he's passionate for God. And God shows up in verses six and seven. He, he puts him in a cleft of a rock and He passes by and He says, "the Lord, the Lord slow to anger and bounding of loving kindness and truth. And yet I will not ignore the sins and the rebellions, but I will give them their just due" 

This passage again was tailored for Moses. Why does the Lord begin slow to anger and abounding in loving kindness and truth, because that was not who Moses was. Moses was quick to anger and short, limited in his patience and loving kindness and graciousness. And so God comes and says to Moses, I am who you are not. It's a contrast and you can trust me. And he's teaching him and he's discipling him. He's getting his person specific curriculum. 

Now that passage is such an impactful truth because so many of us struggle with anger. Do you? I have so over our lives, we can look at the stories of Moses and say, I can identify with that issue. And then God can meet us in that same point. 

That's why he says later in Hosea, what does he require of you, O man? And what does the Lord expect of you? to do justice, to love mercy. See, we love to get even. we'd love to love justice and do mercy when I have to. But I think God reverses that order for Moses, for you, for me so that we come to know Him.

Psalm 23, we see how God spoke to David. He contrasted himself with Moses, but with David, he said, you know, David, you're a shepherd. Look at the things you've learned guarding sheep. I'm like you, I'm a shepherd too, but I'm your shepherd. And David says, yeah, that's true. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want, he makes me lay down beside green pastures. He didn't say the shepherd word to someone who was not a shepherd. He identifies whether it's comparing or contrasting or meeting a need. God comes and reveals relationally. 

And that's how our education should be tailor made to fit the student, not fitting some plan that the teacher has thought up on his or her own without regard to what's going on in their lives.

**Education Sphere 2: God the Father is Our Teacher**

Isaiah 54:13. I will teach all your children and they will enjoy great peace.

The purpose of God's teaching is shaloam. That's not just the absolute absence of conflict. It describes a life in which all relationships are harmonious. And there's a sense of fulfillment of completeness. It's the biblical imagery of thriving and flourishing. And it's not just peace. It says they will enjoy great peace, peace that's enjoyable, peace that is delightful, peace that is welcoming and attractive. His teaching enhances life.

**Education Sphere 3: God the Son is Our Teacher.** 

John 13:12-17. This well-known passage of when Jesus washes the disciples' feet on the night that He is going to be betrayed and taken to court and will lead to His crucifixion, and ultimately His resurrection. They should have been washing His feet or arranged for someone to wash His feet, but they didn't. So He does what was considered the job of the lowliest servant.

After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand what I was doing?

I think that's still a valid question for us today. Do we really get it?

You call me 'Teacher' and you call me Lord,' and you're right, because that's what I am. And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each others feet.

Actually, it's more like you can't aspire to do anything else but wash each other's feet. By affirming who He is as modeling this, He's just changed our world, the value system. The kingdom of God is not like the value system of the world.

I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you. I tell you the truth, slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message. Now that you know these things, God will bless you when you do them.

Now. Several things about Jesus' teaching in this passage is He teaches us through modeling as through servanthood. His actions and His words are one and the same. If we want to be imitators of God in the sphere of education, we must be both doers and speakers of the truth. His example transforms very practically our worldview. 

Now you've probably heard sermons on this. So I'm going to do something a little unusual, I'm going to quote another book. Growing up one of my favorite books (and what led me to study French) was the book by Antoine de **Saint-Exupery, "The Little Prince**" (Le Petit Prince). I'm just doing an excerpt from the end. If you don't know the story, it's all right, but this is an imaginary fairy tale of a little prince that comes from another planet, comes to earth and meets a pilot whose plane had crashed in the Sahara desert, and tells him the story of his adventures through the universe. And on this day he is to return to his planet and to do that he's going to have to die. And he's going to have to leave his friend. That's going to look like it's terrible, but it's actually the only way he can get back to his planet. And he's now saying goodbye. And he says this and this little prince has made him. He's the, he's the little prince on his planet. That's why he's called that. And he's made the pilot laugh a number of times. He's got a delightful contagious laughter. And so he says this:

At night, the little prince says to the pilot, you will look up the stars where I live. Everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It's better like that. My star will just be one of the stars for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars and the heavens. They will all be your friends. And besides I'm going to make you a present. He laughed again. Ah little prince, dear real prince. I love to hear that laughter, the pilot said. 

Well, that is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we would drink the water. 

What are you trying to say, the pilot asked.

All men have the stars, he answered, but they're not the same things for different people. For some who are travelers, the stars are guides; for others, they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others who are scholars, they are problems. Where my businessmen, they are were routes. All these stars are silent. You, you alone will have the stars as no one else has them. What are you trying to say?

Well, in one of the stars, I will be living. In one of them. I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing. When you look at the sky at night, you, only you will have stars that can laugh and laughed again. And when your star was comforted, time soothes all sorrows. You'll be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You'll want to laugh with me and you will sometimes open the window. So for that pleasure and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky. Then you'll say to them, yes. The stars always make me laugh and they will think you are crazy. It would be a very shabby trick that I played on you. And he laughed again. It would be as if in place of the stars, I have given you a great number of little bells at know how to laugh. And he laughed again.

I tell you this story because you've heard about the washing of the feet many times, but we don't get it. What happens with this little parable of the little prince does, it tells the same story in a different way. What the little prince did changed forever the perspective of the pilot, and when he looked at the stars he laughed and everyone thought he was crazy. 

What Jesus has done has changed our perspective. Because of what He's done, we can only aspire to be foot washers and people will look out their windows and think, "you're crazy." And, we know how transformative and wonderful this is. 

Jesus through His lived out teaching turns our mixed up upside down worldview, right side up. Forever changes our value system and makes servanthood something of dignity.

**Education Sphere 4: The Holy Spirit is Our Teacher** 

John 14:26. But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative \- that is the Holy Spirit \- he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.

This is this amazing. All three persons of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are all engaged in teaching us.

A little later that same evening Jesus is talking and he says this. And now two chapters later in chapter 16:12-13, he's telling his disciples, There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can't bear it now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard... Isn't that amazing? Jesus spent three years He had so much more to share and he said, "the Spirit will tell you. He'll tell you what I would have told you, but we ran out of time". God continues to come to us through his written word, through the presence of his Spirit. If we want to learn, he will teach us.

**Education Sphere 5: God The Warrior Teaches Us.** 

Well, that's a surprising title. Isn't it? Well, let's look at Psalm 27:1-5,11. The Lord is my light and my salvation. So why should I be afraid? The Lord is my fortress protecting me from danger, so why should I tremble? When evil people come to devour me, when my enemies and foes attack me, they will stumble and fall. Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will not be afraid. Even if I am attacked, I will remain confident... Teach me how to live, O Lord. Lead me along the right path, for my enemies are waiting for me.

In David's life this language was not a metaphor. It was not poetry. He was a warrior. And there were people who were intent on trying to kill him. But God taught him, and as he listened to the teaching of God, his life was saved. David requests God's instruction because he's in the midst of a battle. But the whole world, is in a spiritual battle. Powers of darkness and light are contending to win their legions of men and women trying to capture their hearts and minds the world over. Ideas have consequences. How we think shapes how we act, forms our worldview and aligns ourselves either against the kingdom of God or with the kingdom of God. Teaching biblical truth is an act of warfare. It enables us to win spiritual battles. In our school systems, our battleground. We need to understand this and contend in prayer and other action for this sphere.

Consider this. Children around the world spend five to eight hours a day in school \- five days a week, nine to 10 months out of the year for 12 to 18 years. We add that all that up, that's some while between 12,000 and 30,000 hours that they are being taught by somebody else. If, over the same amount of time of 12 \-18 years, they spent two to five hours in church once a week, which would be pretty good for most kids, that would be only 1,200 to 4,600 hours. Is there any wonder why we feel like we are losing the battle for their hearts and minds? We have to invest in education. We need to see a generation of people who see this as really valuable and will give their lives to raise up the next generation as teachers in preschools and elementary schools and high schools and universities.

**Education Sphere 6: God The Shepherd Teaches Us.** 

Mark 6:34. Jesus saw the huge crowd as he's stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.

That's not what you would expect. You would think, oh, he's going to feed them is going to do a miracle, He's going to deliver them. He's going to heal them. But these, they were like sheep without a shepherd. It says he began teaching them. Teaching is an act of compassion. It's a Shepherd's act. It's a mercy ministry. It heals. It meets needs, it serves, it transforms. Teaching is an act of warfare and an act of pastoral care.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

We're now going to look at goals and purposes of biblical education. We have seven key passages in this subsection.

**Education Sphere 7: Equipped with Practical Wisdom** 

Proverbs 1:2-7. The purpose of the proverbs is to teach people wisdom and discipline, to help them understand the insights of the wise. Their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives, to help them do what is right, just, and fair. These proverbs will give insight to the simple, knowledge and discernment to the young. Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser. Let those with understanding receive guidance by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables, the words of the wise and their riddles. Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.

So interesting. Both the simple and the wise can benefit from the life-transforming wisdom rooted in the fear of the Lord. We should always remain teachable. Wherever you are in your walk with God, there's always more to learn. Cultivate the humility of being a learner for life. 

The fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge, we read here. Later on in Proverbs 8:13, where we are told that all who the fear the Lord will hate evil. That's one of the very clear definitions. It's not talking about being scared of God. We respect what he's revealed in such a way that we hate the things that he hates, and love the things that he loves. 

True knowledge is more than just cognitive acquisition. It's a passionate embrace of what is good, and it disciplines shunning of evil because we hate it. It's about love and hate. These are, there's passion in these words. We are ensnared by evil thinking, oftentimes, because we're tempted when we are deluded into thinking that doing this evil thing will somehow be good or delightful or pleasant or beneficial. And afterwards, you know, when you've sinned, you think there's going to be really great. And then you go ugh, you just feel slimy, yucky. And this is what God's teaching is about to show us beforehand that evil is evil. And so we would avoid it and run from it. Wisdom emerges when we see evil for what it is and detest it, we loathe it. We abandoned it. We flee from it. We flee from the very thought of it.

**Education Sphere 8: The Purpose of My Instruction.** 

1 Timothy 1:5. So this is the elder apostle training the younger church leader. He says this: The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience and genuine faith.

What more can you say? So good. Love. A pure heart. Clear conscious. Genuine faith. Isn't that what we all desire? That's what God wants for us.

**Education Sphere 9: Applied Truth Brings Blessing to Society.** 

Deuteronomy 28:13. If you listen to these commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today, and if you carefully obey them, the Lord will make you the head and not the tail, and you will always be on top and never be at the bottom.

God's way's are always beneficial. Enhancing life, both for the individual and for our culture, our nation, our community. Its good individually and corporately. He gives us these commands to enhance life. That's the purpose of this truth, of this teaching.

**Education Sphere 10: God Desires Education That Transforms.** 

Deuteronomy 5:29-31. Oh, that they would always have hearts like this, that they might fear me and obey all my commands\! If they did, they and their descendants would prosper forever. Go and tell them, "Return to your tents." But you stand here with me so I can give you all my commands, decrees, and regulations. You must teach them to the people so they can obey them in the land I am giving them as their possession.

When we read this passage and other passages like it, we must listen to the longing in God's heart. This is not a static, stale, impassionate set of rules and regulations. 

"O that they would always listen to me." He wants to do so much good.

As a father I know that at times when I've had a plan for something really special for my kids on a Saturday. I wanted to take them out, And in the morning they get up fussy and fighting and screaming and bickering. And I have to forego the good plan I had because they're not living as they should with their siblings. That is such a disappointment to me. And they don't have any idea what they're missing out on because they're lost in their petty world. That's what happens with us so many times. 

His instructions are for our good, they're not to encumber us, or weight us down or burden us. His heart breaks when we stray from His ways because harm will come to us. It's not the best for us. Our choices have consequences and God wants to bless us. He wants us to prosper forever. That's what He says of the prosper forever, to thrive, to flourish, to experience life in all of its abundance and beauty and all of its potential realized, that's what he wants for us. So let's obey God, let's listen, let's follow his instruction and allow him to transform us.

**Education Sphere 11: is Transformed Lives** 

Acts 4:13. The members of the council \[This is the Jewish leadership council, The Sanhedrin\] were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, \[who had just been taken out of prison for proclaiming the gospel and healing the man at the Gate Beautiful\] for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures. They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus.

Their training was not the formal rabbinic education that they so valued. But they had spent time in a discipleship relationship being mentored by Jesus. It showed. It made a difference in their lives. It was not just their words, but their actions, their attitudes, their mannerisms, their accents, everything about them, their life reflected Jesus. 

We are transformed by the lives of the people that we spend the most time with. They spent the last three years with Jesus. How much time are you and I spending with Jesus and with other people who are spending time with Jesus? What occupies most of your time? Or even better, who occupies most of your time? Can people look at your life \-- can they look at my life and say, I see that he, she has spent time with Jesus? Wow. What a great testimony that they had been taught by the Master teacher. We can be too.

**Education Sphere 12: Transform Society.**   
And we're gonna be reading from Leviticus 18:1-5. Then the Lord said to Moses, Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. I am the Lord your God. So do not act like the people in Egypt, where you used to live, or like the people of Canaan, where I'm taking you. You must not imitate their way of life. You must obey all my regulations and be careful to obey my decrees, for I am the Lord your God. If you obey my decrees and my regulations, you'll find life through them. I am the Lord.   
You know, we're looking at how we can be a blessing to the culture and bring Godly transformation into the societies where we're living. And we need to know that where we've been in the past, our previous experience and where we're going, what we think might be good, are not necessarily the standard we want to follow. The Israelites had lived among Egyptians with all of their idolatry and their broken worldviews. They were going to Canaan amongst another people group that had were idolatrous and had a broken worldviews. And God says don't imitate them. There's a desire always to conform because that's how you get acceptance. That's a way to feel included and belonging.   
But God calls His people to be different, to show a third way, an alternative, a different way of doing life, a different way of thinking and acting. That is what is important. And so he says, don't imitate them. You know, you are either going to be a shaper of your culture or you're gonna be shaped by your culture. You can't have it both ways. And there's this degree of uncomfortableness when we rise up in grace and truth, to shape culture. There’s resistance at times. There's conflict at times. But we need to exhibit the kingdom of God in the most gracious and loving way possible.   
God wants us to understand that the only way we can be those genuine culture shapers is if we root all our actions on the word of the Lord, following him, listening and obeying him. The commands he gives us. That's the foundation. We can't just shape culture by following our own good ideas. We must build it on God's ideas, on God's word. And that changes society.   
When we commit ourselves to obeying God, God promises to be with us and to endorse and support us in those efforts. And he says, if you do this, it’s gonna be beneficial. He says, you'll find life in doing things my way, in doing things God's way. And if we'll do this, we're pursuing life for ourselves, for our families, for our communities, for our society. And if we'll be true to God's word, we'll see life thriving and flourishing. Shalom \- God’s peace and presence. Present everywhere. Bringing transformation, life and hope.

**Education Sphere 13: Revelation in the Potter's House** 

Jeremiah 18:1-11. This is a long passage that is worth your time to read it in its entirety. Here are just a few selections.

God tells Jeremiah Go down to the potter's shop and I will speak to you there. So he’s watches the Potter. He makes a pot. I don't know if you've ever seen this happen, if you haven’t, go and visit a Potter's shop. I was trained in pottery-making. It's a wonderful art. And as you form a pot, it's just it's pliable. You can shape it in your hand, but sometimes you mess up and get off center, it wobbles and you just have to crunch it all up, pack it up and start over again. And so Jeremiah is observing this; out out of this ball of clay can make, or unmake a particular shape. And so the Potter is always responsive to what he sees the clay doing on the Potter's wheel. In light of that God says this to Jeremiah:

…If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. And if I announced that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom, but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless it as I said I would.

So that's the principle. And it actually, those words are like the principle that guide all of the prophetic books. God wants to bless. He wants to extend mercy and compassion. But at times he has to apply judgment and exercise justice. And which will he apply at any given moment? It's how the pot responds in his hands. It's how the clay responds. And so he doesn't have a fixity of approach. He's telling you the principles and saying, "Be pliable in my hands, then I can bless you." 

So after all of that teaching, he ends up with this statement: "...So turn from your evil ways, each of you and do what is right." Because then God can bless. 

Understanding God's ways should lead us to repentance and right living. God is engaged with us in space and time. This is so exciting when we get this, God is not distant. He's not fictional. He's not an abstraction. He's journeying through history with us and responding as we act, he, he acts and it's a interactive, it's better than an Xbox. You know, it’s, you do something with the controls and something changes on the screen.

God is paying attention to us. And depending on what we do, he responds in the appropriate way. This is a genuine relationship and He can apply the justice that he must apply if we disobey or the mercy that he desires to apply, if we will turn in repentance. He'll do whatever is appropriate. Applying the right action in the right circumstances requiring, those responses from our hearts. 

This revelation, this insight, this teaching enables us to know how to walk with God in a meaningful way as individuals and as societies. Education is transformative when we understand God's character and God's ways.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

We are now going to talk about biblical guidelines for teachers. And we have nine key passages that we'll consider in this area.

**Education Sphere 14: Study. Obey. Teach.** 

It comes from Ezra 7: 10-11.... Ezra had determined to study and obey the law of the Lord and to teach those decrees and regulations to the people of Israel... Ezra …studied and taught the commands and decrees of the Lord to Israel...

Now you need to be a student before you can be a teacher. And you need to always be a student if you're going to be a good teacher. Your own passion and thirst and hunger for growing in truth, and applying it in your life is that which is contagious to the students that you're teaching. If you've quit learning or learning is something stale in your life, you're never going to be able to make your students enthusiastic about learning themselves. So an unending hunger for learning will inspire your students to become learners too.

Similar to this passage in Ezra, Luke, at the beginning of Acts one speaks of Jesus and summarizes the whole gospel, saying in that first book he talked about all that Jesus began to do and to teach \-- do and teach. You have to study, you have to do, you have to obey, and then you can teach. That's what gives authority. We get this time and again in the scriptures. In Luke 24:19 at the very end of that gospel, Jesus meets disciples on the road to Emmaus. So they don't get recognized him. And he asks them what they're talking about, and they said we're talking about this man named Jesus, who was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. See how those two go together?

In Colossians 3 :17, Paul says, and whatever you do, whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord. Jesus can mean things to God. The father, through him all also writes in second Thessalonians 2:16-17, may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, encourage your heart and strengthen you in every good deed and word. These are always supposed to go in hand.

**Education Sphere 15: Teach Well.** 

Romans 12:7. …If you are a teacher teach well.

That's pretty straightforward. Whatever you do, whatever vocation you're called to, whatever sphere you're in, you need to learn how to do it well. We read in the scriptures that Jesus did everything excellently. That's what we need to aspire. If you are a teacher teach well, cultivate the skill, develop the art, do it with all your heart, recognize it as a high calling and give yourself full- heartedly to it.

You know, we need a Renaissance of millions and millions of young people in this generation who see teaching as a vocation that is worthy of their life. Who, in obedience to God, will say "I'll be a preschool teacher", an elementary teacher, high school teacher, because this is how we change the next generation. We need to do that. And just every, just millions and millions of people. So I pray that if you feel a tug in your heart while you're listening to this, maybe God is speaking to you that you need to equip yourself to be a teacher, to raise up a generation of young people who will know and obey God.

**Education Sphere 16: Spirit and Truth.** 

This is in John 4:23-24. Jesus is talking with the Samaritan woman who was at the well. This is the longest private conversation He has as recorded in the gospels with anyone individual. And at this point in the conversation, she's a little shocked that He, a Jew, is talking to her, a Samaritan, because these did not have usual conversations. And so she has asked some theology, like, where should we worship, in Jerusalem at the temple on this mountain? And Jesus says this,

...the time is coming \- indeed, it's here now \- when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. The Father is looking for those who will worship him that way. For God is Spirit, so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.

All needs to be done in spirit and truth, not just worship. We need to live our life in spirit and truth. We need to teach in spirit and truth. And just like He's looking for worshipers who worship in spirit and truth, He is looking for teachers who will teach in spirit and truth, who understand the subject matter, who have the truth, who have the content who prepare the curriculum, but who, who know how to be sensitive to the spirit on any given day to be able to flex, to, to serve the needs of the students. 

Every area of life needs to be in spirit and truth. The Hebrew word **Avodah** is translated both as "work" and "worship" in the Old Testament. So our vocation, when done in obedience to God is worshipful. If teaching is your vocation, what God's called you to do, and you do it well, you are worshiping God through the act of teaching. Following the biblical curriculum, and being sensitive to the promptings of the Spirit in all your activities in the classroom and outside of the classroom \-- that is what God is looking for.

**Education Sphere 17: Know Your Audience**

Mark 7:2-4. They noticed that some of his disciples \[this is the religious leaders again\] failed to follow the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating. (The Jews, especially the Pharisees, do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands, as required by their ancient traditions. Similarly, they don't eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands in water. This is but one of many traditions they have clung to...

Now, in most translations that that last part is all in parenthesis. And because it's like the author’s kind of explaining to the audience, he knows the audience, doesn't understand why don't they get upset about not washing their hands in this particular way. And it's just like we met when we looked, how God tailored the revelation that teaching for Abraham and Moses and David, he taught them exactly what they needed in their context. So you need to teach as a teacher being aware of the context of knowledge, the foundation of what your students already have. 

Mark knew his audience. He was writing in Rome. He had just gone through the **XXXX** persecution. Peter and Paul had probably just been martyred and the church, according to the early church historian **XXXX** requested that Mark write down all the stories that Peter had often shared. In a sense, this is really Peter's gospel. But because Peter was not the linguist that Mark was; Mark, we’re told, was his translator. So he told the stories time and time again. And at times when he was in the process of translating, he could see the confused faces on his audience. Like, why are they doing that? What does that mean? Because Rome was a very far away from Jerusalem, totally different cultural context. And so he added explanatory notes. He gave the context as Gentiles living in Rome. 

Now it's interesting. The same story is told in Matthew 15\. But Matthew is a Jew writing to Jews and he tells a story and he just says, he knows that some disciples were eating without washing their hands. He goes on with the story and skips those two verses that are in a parenthesis. Why? He understood why, his audience, his fellow Jews understood why. They didn't need that, the explanation, the context. 

So just as you compare these passages, you see what a good teacher does. He knows the audience and gives the information that helps them successfully understand what's going on.

**Education Sphere 18: Use Didactic Creativity.** 

Your teaching should be full of variety. For this, we are going to read Exodus 4:1-11. And again, this is a long passage. So I'm just going to do a few highlights. This is Moses' encounter with God at the day when he's deciding to go back to Egypt, he's 80 years old and begin the process of seeing the Jewish people, the Hebrew people liberated from Egypt.

Moses protested again, "What if they won't believe me or listen to me? ... Then the Lord asked him, "What is that in your hand?"

"A shepherd's staff", Moses replied. "Throw it down on the ground," the Lord told him. So Moses threw down the staff, and it turned into a snake\!

That would've been a startling moment. I imagined he jumps several steps back, being very careful, and then God said something else. And he says, now pick it up and pick it up by the tail. And if you know anything about picking up a snake, you'd never pick it up by the tail. You would try to grab it right behind its head so that you can control its mouth. That's the dangerous part. 

Well, he obeys, and the moment he does that, the snake becomes a staff again. Wow. Double surprise. Okay? Does God have his attention? Yeah, he's teaching him. What’s He teaching? That you can trust him. If you obey Him powerful things will happen and good things will happen. You can do things that are counterintuitive by picking up a snake by the tail and it won't harm you.

So then the second lesson comes up. And then the Lord said to Moses, now put your hand inside your cloak. So he does this. So Moses put his hand inside his cloak and he took out again, his hand was white as snow. He had leprosy.

I mean, the one thing was the snake that's there, but this is you. **You’re changed.** That this was like, in those days, like the death sentence, like hearing you have terminal cancer. There was no cure. There was no way out of it. You were ostracized from the community. 

And so God says, put your hand in your cloak again. Like, I don't know why I even have a hand? Why don't you just, you know, just bones, what's going to happen? There's the learning that he can trust the word of the Lord. Even though he's not certain of the outcome, God's word is going to be trustworthy. So he puts it in, comes out and it’s perfectly fine.

So God shows him that he's going to be powerful, he is going to act with him. And he can be trusted. But Moses, the story goes, But Moses pleaded with the Lord. Oh God, I'm not very good with words. The Lord said to Moses who made a person's mouth? Is it not I the Lord?

And sometimes we think that we only teach with words and you say, "I'm not very good with words". And God says, "I'm going to do my thing through you." If I've called you to be a teacher you may see incapacities in your own life, just like Moses saw his life. But God will use you. He's formed you. He loves you. He cares for you. And he can use you.

God used a lot of creative means to teach Moses that He was capable and trustworthy. He uses cognitive issues, affective issues, and psychomotor issues. Sometimes we say “head, hands, and heart”, those are easier ways to say it, but we have to, if you have a teacher, you've got to know that they're different learning styles. Some people are auditory learners, some are visual learners, some are hands-on learners. And these, all these different preferences of learning \- that we have to be equipped. 

Like God did varieties of different things for all Moses to have a variety of methodologies to serve all of our students, not just a few. It's not about them meeting your preferred standard but you serving them. Teachers are servants. Don't force students into a cookie cutter like mold, but they adjust methodologies to help each individual pupil in a way that's appropriate for the gift sets.

We have a training program called Teaching For Life that we've used to teach many educators around the world in Youth With A Mission. And we often begin this, this seminar. These are people who are already educators, but they're really honing their gifts with a kingdom perspective. And we begin by giving them all beautiful flowers.

Each flower is different, and we give them a few minutes to look at the flowers and study the colors and enjoy the beauty of it. Each one needs to present their flower to the group and talk about the beauty of their flower. And so they'll say, well, this beautiful purple flower and or this golden flower has these many petals. And the leaves are soft to the touch. And they, they all described their flowers. And, and as they spend that time and you see them coming to really like their particular flower.

After everyone's shared, they put them all on the table and then they take a rolling pin and start rolling over the top of all of the flowers and crush them so that they are all the same. And people start crying and shouting saying, don't do that\! You're ruining the beauty\!

But isn't that what we do in some of our educational systems? All of these children with such a beautiful diversity of gifts come in and we try to put them all through the same mass system, and they get it. And then they start saying, as a teacher, I want to be one who honors and serves each individual flower and finds the appropriate way of communicating that.

**Education Sphere 19: Create a Cohortive Relational Context** 

Luke 8:1-2a.Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages, preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God. He took his 12 disciples with him, along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases…

Jesus always ministered with an entourage around Him. There's more than just the twelve. Luke several times talked about the Twelve and the Women. This was the learning community that He had developed. They were designed. We've all been designed to learn together. So some things you can learn on your own, but other things that you learn best in a group.

Um, you know, in 1 Timothy 4:13, it says, depending on the translation, devote yourself or focus on or pay attention to the public reading of scripture. Sometimes we read the scripture by ourselves, but in this passage it says pay attention or make it a high priority. That's what means, devote yourself, being passionate about, reading the of scripture together. And of course, back in the day, it was necessary because many people didn't know how to read and write, but today it's so powerful. The more time I spend in God's ways and in God's word, the more I'm convinced that this is supposed to be a corporate, communal, cohortive, supportive environment that we grow together. That's why Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there. 

So let's come together and form habits of reading the word out loud together. That's why we have this SourceView Bible that you've been using in this tool that is a four color so that you can read with three others. And you can read the scriptures out loud together in an easy way. Education happens best in a collaborative environment, not in a competitive environment. Competition is great for the sports; collaboration is great for education.

**Education Sphere 20: Pray for Your Students.** 

I'm going to read Ephesians some of Ephesians 3:14 \- 21, which is the fifth prayer that Paul prays in this short letter. This is some of the prayer:

When I think of all of this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father, the Creator of everything in heaven and earth. I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit... May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you'll be made complete with all the fullness of life and the power that comes from God...who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we can ask or think ... 

Or even dare to imagine. 

Amen. What an amazing prayer. When you unpack its like he prays that they'll be filled with all the fullness of God, all the fullness of Jesus, all the fullness of the Spirit, all the fullness of love. And then you can ask anything and everything. Anything you can think of, anything you could imagine, the anything, you can dream, and God can do that and more\! Now I can dream of a lot. I can imagine a lot and God can do more. This is just an amazing prayer. He's praying this for them, but this is just one of his prayers. 

You know, throughout this book, if you read it carefully, I count at least seven different prayers, seven prayers in six chapters, there are 36 of 155 verses are prayers. That's almost one fourth of the book, 23.2% The first prayer is chapter one, verse two, he says, amen.

And then he immediately launches into another prayer. It goes from verse three to 14\. He paused a little bit, catches his breath and then launches into prayer for the third time. And chapter one verses 17 to 23\. Then he prays in chapter three 13, just before the passage we read which is the fifth one. And then again, a sixth prayer in chapter four verses four to six, and finally a concluding prayer in chapter six, verse 23 to 24\. He's praying continuously for them while he's teaching them. He teaches, he prays. He teaches, he prays. He teaches, he prays. He teaches and prays. This is the model. He's one of the most extraordinary instructors that we have in the scriptures. And it's just laced with prayer.

**Education Sphere 21: Teachers are Judged By a Higher Standard)** 

We are to be judged… Teachers are Judged by a Higher Standard. James 3:1: Dear brothers and sisters. Not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged more strictly.

Now. Paul was not trying to discourage people from teaching. He is saying, "Pay attention. If you're going to be a teacher, you will be held to a higher standard. Jesus tells us in Luke \- a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn't prepared and doesn't carry out those instructions will be severely punished, but someone who does not know, and then does something wrong will be punished only lightly. When someone has been given much, much will be required in return. And when someone has been entrusted with much, even more will be required, this is Luke 12:47-48.

Light equals responsibility. As you grow in knowledge and wisdom, each of us along the path of life are, grow in our understanding our insight, if we are following the Lord. And so we grow in our responsibility. This is the way life is. And if we stay stagnant, we're not doing what God wants us to do. We need to be growing, but we should not \- we don't have the same expectations on ourselves today that we had, when we were 12 years old. We know more, we're responsible for more. That's what, what he's saying.

And so as a teacher, if you're telling the truth, you're speaking the truth. You understand that you need to be living it. So once again, just like we've considered several times is — the doing and the speaking must be in harmony. That's what's being emphasized. So be a teacher, but be a practitioner who teaches and then God will use your life to extend his kingdom.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

In the last section, we looked at biblical guidelines for teachers. And now we're going to shift and look for biblical guidelines for students. There are eight passages in the scriptures that we're going to be looking at.

**Education Sphere 22:  Imitate the Master.** 

This comes from Leviticus 19:1-2. The Lord also said to Moses, give the following instructions to the entire community of Israel. You must be Holy because I, the Lord your God, am Holy.

As I look at this passage, I'm reminded of my experience at university. As a Freshman, I was eager about all the content of courses. I picked subjects that I thought would be interesting. I very quickly learned that I just, I go to the rest of my studies, not by the topic of the course but who was the teacher. I found out who were the best professors, who are the ones who have really invest time with the students? Who are the ones that I wanted to be more like? And I picked courses. I ended up studying subjects that I never thought I would have studied, but because of who was teaching it, I knew that I would benefit from that class.

Following your teacher is really important. First Peter, 2:21, Peter says, speaking of Jesus that we're to follow in his steps. Paul in Ephesians 5:1 says imitate God, therefore, everything you do because you are his dear children.

This is really important. We imitate those whom we feel relationally close to. And if we're loved, if we're valued, it's easy to follow them. It's easy to follow God because he loves us so very much. We are His dear children.

We find a number of other passages that are very interesting and scriptures of this area. And the sermon on the Mount in the last verse, Matthew 5:48. It says you are to be perfect. Jesus says, even as your father in heaven is perfect. That seems like an unattainable challenge, but it's how you're making the comparison. God has all knowledge and lives up to all the truth that He knows. We have partial knowledge, but we're perfect like him if we live up to all the truth that we know. He is not expecting us to be God, but He's expecting us to be imitators of God.

In the parallel passage of this in Luke is often called the Sermon on The Plain. And Luke 6:36, it says you must be compassionate and merciful just as your father is compassionate. So we start seeing a pattern arise. You must be holy because God is holy, must be perfect because He is perfect, compassionate, because He's compassionate. You could keep adding the list as you discover more about God. You must be servant-hearted like He is servant-hearted, you must be generous or kind. You must be forgiving. The list can go on. The point is you're pursuing the Master. You're getting to know Him and who he is, is what you want to emulate. That is what you want to incorporate into your life. 

The key begins is to be a really good student with the passionate pursuit of God, understanding that the knowledge of God is the foundation for all true knowledge. And it's the means for beginning a journey of transformation. The more we get to know Him, the more He's at work in our lives, the more we become transformed to be like Him.

**Education Sphere 23: Consider Jesus.** 

This comes from Hebrews 3:1, I love this. It says the following. And so dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and our partners with those called to heaven (and that wonderful. We were partners with those called to heaven), think carefully about this Jesus, whom we declared to be God's messenger and high priest.

Other translations say think deeply or consider or ponder upon, or meditate about Jesus. 

Now actually the whole book of Hebrews is about considering Jesus. It follows an ancient genre that was used for in political elections. When people were championing the person that they were wanting to have be the governor or this particular role in this city, they developed, an art form that was called a **\[synchrisis?\].** And what it did is they did, it recounted all the greats in the city's past and with each person that they brought up, they compare it to the candidate that they were promoting. And they would say, well, so-and-so was great, but my candidate is greater. That person did so much good for the city, but my candidate is greater. He's better. He's more marvelous. And so they'd run through how past a famous persons in their nation were great educators or great military generals or statesmen, or had benefited the economy of the city. And then in every situation, their candidate is better. 

Hebrews is like this political speech because he is wanting everyone **to \_\_\_** Jesus as king. 

During the time of persecution is it's easier to hide and not acknowledge Jesus as king, because if you did, you challenge Caesar and you would be in trouble. But he began to say, angels are marvelous, but Jesus is better. Chapter two Moses, he was pretty amazing, but he was just a servant in the house of God. Jesus is the Son in the house of God. He's, he's better. Then Joshua. He took him into the promised land, but that inheritance only lasted for so many generations. Jesus and his inheritance is better. Then he shifts to the priest. He talks about how Melchizedek and Aaron and the Levites. And in every case, Jesus is better; with better covenant, a better sacrifices. He's better, He's better, He's better\! 

And so if you're listening to this, this form of speech is not a letter. It's this political electoral speech. By the time people are reading this, they're like, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus\! I mean the whole point is Iike, every, hero of the past in every category \- governmental, spiritual, religious Jesus is better.

And we come to chapter 11 and we know as much as the chapter of faith, of course there weren't chapters. It was one continuous story. And it has all these greats that talked about Abraham and Sarah, Rahab, and Gideon and David and Barack and all these amazing people. But the point and we stop there because the chapter's over, but the message didn't stop. He lists all these people, not for you to look at them as the people of faith, but to keep reading or keep listening. And in chapter 12 it says, fix your eyes on Jesus. They had, these greats had faith. Jesus is the very definition of faith. He is the beginning of faith is the end of the faith. He's the sum total of faith. He's better than all of them combined. Fix your eyes on Jesus. So chapter three, verse one, you have considered Jesus. Fix your mind on Jesus and chapter 12:2, it says, fix your eyes on Jesus. So your thoughts and your focus needs to be centered on the person of Jesus. 

When we have God as our foundation and Jesus, at the center of all that we are, then we are really positioned to have really good education.

**Education Sphere 24: Hunger for God and His Word.** 

This comes from Psalm 19:7-11 The instructions of the Lord are perfect, reviving the soul. The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The commandments of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are clear, giving insight for living. Reverence for the Lord is pure, lasting forever. The laws of the Lord are true, each one is fair. They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey even honey dripping from the comb. They are a warning to your servant, a great reward for those who obey them.

This is such a beautiful description of God's word and all the good it brings to into our lives. 

One of the things that I've cultivated as a discipline in my own life is to regularly pray for hunger and for thirst. I do that for myself. I do it for my family. I do it for my colleagues. I do it for my friends. Pray for hunger and thirst. Lord increase my hunger, make me thirstier, make me thirstier. Do not let me be satisfied with my current state of affairs. I want more understanding more of your word, more of your life, more of your ways, more of your insight for all these challenges I might be facing. I need to be taught by you. But not, I don't want to be taught in a begrudging manner. So I want to be hungry, yearning, longing, thirsty. I encourage you. Pray that regularly for yourself. Pray that over all your loved ones. May there'll be a revival of hunger in our midst. A revival of thirst that we run hard after God.

**Education Sphere 25: Approach Learning with Faith in God.** 

This comes from James 1:5-6. If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. But when you ask him to be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waiver...

We can ask God confidently. You know, if you look at all the verbs in the Bible that are associated with God, about 17,000 times that it says God does something. Of all the things that says God does the third, most frequently repeated thing is God gives. As one of the top three things, characteristics of God- His incredible generosity. He's not as stingy God. You don't have to talk him into giving you wisdom. He is longing for it, he was saying like, if you just asked me, here it is. So he's generous. He's he's on the edge of his seat waiting to invest in you. So just come, ask with confidence. He's not a with-holder of information, He is a Revealer of wisdom. He will be generous with you.

**Education Sphere 26: Think about These Things.** 

This comes from Philippians 4:8. And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing …

So he's wrapping up this letter. This is one of the wonderful letters of Paul. Most of his letters, he's addressing problems in the church and this letter he's thanking them for their support. So this is like the happy letter. He’s not doing a lot of correction, he is rejoicing in their participation with them in the extension of the gospel, but he is Paul. So he always has exhortations. So the final thing is this, fix your thoughts or think about what is true, what is honorable and right, and pure and lovely and admirable. Think about these things that are, that are excellent and worthy of praise.

Think about these things. Ponder, meditate. Consider. Take time. You don't just read the list. You're supposed to pause. 

We were talking about the spheres. One exercise that I've done easily over the last years. As, as I, I write these, items, down on the list. And across the top I will write the names of the spheres \- family, or pick two or three, say family and economics and education. And then I asked myself, what makes a family honorable? What makes a family lovely? What makes it family worthy of praise? And I try to define those things from God's perspective. 

What makes economics \- what makes a true economics, or pure economics or excellent economics? What is it about education that is right or honorable or worthy of praise? And we can all think about things like that. And you can pick other categories, but if you just take a category and say, what would God's perspective be on this? And you start filling it out. That gives you some very concrete things.

You know, you might say, well, it's lovely in a family when they have dinners together and they're not rushed, they can just sit and talk \- parents and children. I've been to families that have done that. And it's just really nice to be in that household. I've been to other families where they're rushing all the time and no one's eating together and that's just not the same. And so you can develop by asking those questions, by thinking on these things; definitions, goals, metrics, things to aspire for them. Things to which you would, could reach out and seek to obtain. 

Friends, the Bible is teaching us not just what to do. It's teaching us more importantly, how to think, how to learn. And if we will bring these questions before God and say, will you teach me about what's true in family and government and media? What's true in my city and my community, my home? What's true in my workplace \- teach me what is that? What's admirable? You just go through that. Think about it, take time. He will teach you. And He will use you to help bring transformation with this educational process that He's doing in and through your life to be transformation where you live.

**Education Sphere 27: Eagerness to Apply.** 

This comes from Matthew 7:24-27. The final words of this, of the sermon on the Mount: Anyone that listens to my teaching Jesus says and follows it is wise… The key phrase is, and follows it. Listening is not enough. It's listening and following. It's like the person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents, and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it's built on bedrock. But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it, is foolish like a person who builds a house on sand. When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.

So again, hearing in and of itself has no beneficial virtue, but hearing followed by application of the word is highly transformational. This is wisdom. The goal of education is not to amass knowledge, it is to have a changed life. The goal of education is not to be an information bank, but to be a wise person.

**Education Sphere 28: Teachableness Versus Pride.** 

This comes from Psalm 131:1-3. Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don't concern myself with matters too great or too awesome for me to grasp. Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mother's milk. Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me. O Israel, put your hope in the Lord \-- now and always.

What the psalmist is teaching us is that we need to be childlike. Jesus says the same thing. That unless we become like those children, we can't enter the kingdom of God. It doesn't mean that we are immature. It means that we are teachable. Little children are not pretentious. They don't mind asking questions. They recognize that adults have information that they don't have. And so they'll ask questions nonstop, sometimes to the extent that you moms and dads say, go away, leave me alone, that’s just because. And we sometimes shut down that inquisitive, childlike curiosity. But we need to childlike and just trust God and cultivate that again because pride leads us to being embarrassed. We want to be ones who already know, I don't want to expose my ignorance or my need. And I try to posture myself. 

You know, the definition of pride is not really being superior. You can be prideful in many ways. Pride means a lack of willingness to be known for who you really are. Humility is walking in transparency, to be known with the strengths and the weaknesses, with the areas of grace in your life and the foibles. There's no pretense in humility. There's all kinds of posturing with pride. And when you're posturing, you can’t learn. If you're walking in transparency, in humility, you're in a posture that will allow yourself to grow and learn.

**Education Sphere 29: Press on. Press on. Press on.**  

This comes from Hosea 6:3. Oh, that we might know the Lord\! Let us press on to know him. He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawn or the coming of rains in early spring.

Skills are developed with practice. It was once asked, how do you get to Carnegie hall? This famous theater is in New York, where the top musicians play instruments, and singers sing. And the answer is "practice, practice, practice". One of my professors at university that I just adored and I benefitted so much from his life, he said, "The essence of education is constant repetition." There are things that you just have to work at, going over and over again to develop brain muscles, to gain spiritual muscles, or physical muscles, in whatever area you're working on developing. There's power in perseverance.

I find myself often encouraged by the words in Proverbs 24:16, it says The godly may trip seven times… I take courage from that, because I know I trip up sometimes. I don't think, do things perfectly. I'm not flawless. I mess up. I sin. It's not that the godly is the one who never trips up\! Then I'm would, just be left out in the cold. The verse doesn't stop there. So the godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again. They come back into a place of grace. They come into with quick repentance. They come into the presence of God. They're persevering. They're not going to give up because they've encountered a problem in the road.

Revelation 3:10 says we're commanded to persevere. Hebrews 10:36 says, patience endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised. How? Through patient endurance. 

In a similar way, 1 Timothy 4:16 says, Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you.

Keep a close watch, persevere, keep at it. Don’t give up, keep at it. Press on, press on, press on.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

In this next section, we're going to be looking at 11 passages that deal with the principles and practices of biblical education.

**Education Sphere 30: Begin always With God's Revelation.**   
We're gonna read from 2 Kings 22:8.  Hilkiah the high priest at that time said to Shaphan the court's secretary, I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord's Temple. Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphen and he read it.   
The reason this passage is so exciting is that it'd been a couple generations since this book had been lost. Now, scholars think that the Book of the Law probably refers to the scroll of Deuteronomy, not just a scroll, THE scroll of Deuteronomy, like it had been missing for decades and no one knew where it was. And when Josiah became king and he, at a very young age and he had a heart for God, he asked the Levitical leaders to repair the temple. You see, his father and grandfather had been idolators. They had turned away from God. They'd not only abandoned the true faith in the Creator redeeming God, but they'd actually brought idols into the Temple and were using the Temple as a place to worship false gods. Josiah wanted to make all of that right, so he ordered them to clean and rearrange and purify the temple. And in that process, they're in some back room in some storage area and they find a scroll. And it had been lost for all this time. This such a significant thing. So when he said, I have found it, this was a momentous point in history, it was a turning point that was changed the course of what would happen in the remainder of the story of Josiah's life and the all who lived in that generation. Everything had been decayed and broken down. But this day that news, there was a fresh hope.   
So when Shaphan, the king's secretary, took it back to the king, he read it before the king. Josiah wept. He tore his clothes and he repented. Because as he heard the story of Deuteronomy, God's covenant with Israel, he realized how far they had strayed from God's purposes. And so he called all the leaders of the society together, the religious leaders, the political leaders, the business leaders, the cultural leaders, the educators. And together they met in the central place of the city and they read the whole book together. All of them wept, all of them turned to God. There was cultural, societal-wide repentance. And a great awakening began. One of the greatest times of spiritual revival in the history of the nation of Judah.   
Why? Because they went back to the Word of God. When you begin with God's revelation, when you begin with God's word, you begin with the foundation that can change hearts and minds and actions. It can change individuals and families and whole societies and cultures. That was what was going on.   
So as we think about that in our times, let's see a revival happen in reading the word of God. Not just a few verses here or there, but whole books in their entirety like Shaphan did, when he was handed the scroll of Deuteronomy. And may we learn from God, may our education begin with him and his word and be the foundation for all that we do from that point onward.

**Education Sphere 31: Question Asking is Important.**   
We're gonna be reading from the book of Jonah 1:8 . In this particular passage, Jonah has disobeyed God, is running away from God. He sets sail and heading in the opposite direction. And a storm comes up and everyone's wondering, why did this storm suddenly emerge? Why? Why are we experiencing this? And so the text is this, Why has this awful storm come down on us?… Who are you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality? In this one verse, it's like firing rapid fire. Question after question after question. They knew that something was wrong and they needed to have an answer. That's how you begin a learning process. Asking good questions will lead you to great insight. Question after question after question. He didn't have time to respond.   
You know, when we read the Bible, we should read it with an active posture.   
You don't read the Bible fruitfully if you read it passively. If you read it like you watch television, you know, when you watch television, you kind of just sit back and ah, allow the images and the sounds to entertain you. It's more like, reading the Bible should be like interacting with a video game and you realize if you've got that console, how you input into that console affects the images on the screen. And so your active participation shapes the storyline. When we read the scriptures, we should come with questions in mind, seeking to understand so that God can speak to us. And like the basic question that you should always have in mind is who did what to whom, when, where, why, how, and with what result? See those questions, that’s a long question that you can unpack in several different ways, are open-ended questions. And you can ask that of nearly every single verse of the Bible and unpack piece by piece and get insights.   
Now, many of us grew up in cultures where we were not encouraged to ask questions. It may have been seen as rude or inappropriate or disrespectful to ask a question. Maybe you were in a family when you asked a question and your father said, don't bother me, can’t you see I'm busy? Or you would ask a question in school and, and the teacher made fun of you and all the children laughed and you said, I'm never going to ask a question again.   
But you know, God loves question asking. He encourages question asking. And he never laughs at your questions and he's always got time for your questions. One of the books of the Bible that highlights this in a beautiful way is the Book of Job. Job talks about this dear man who was greatly beloved by God, who feared the Lord, who walked in the fear of the Lord, in integrity and was just an example in his generation of what it meant to love and obey God. And he went through a really hard time. This, there's a lot about this story that we won't talk about now, but in that hard time, he wanted to understand what was going on. Why was he suffering as he was suffering? And so in the process of the book, Job asked 125 questions.   
Now he had some friends come along and at the beginning they were really friend friendly because they kept the mouths shut and just empathized with him. But then they tried to answer his questions and refute his questions and say, you shouldn't be asking those questions. And and there's a this great conflict.   
After a while they give up on Job. And finally God appears. And when God appears, he doesn't go Job, question one- here is answer one. Question two \-here is answer two. Question three here is answer three. You know what God does? He asked Job more questions. It's almost as if he says to Job, don't give up. Don't quit asking those questions. There's more that you need to be thinking about. And God asked Job 75 questions. And through that process he said, there's a few more things you need to think about. And if you'll ponder on these, you'll this will lead you to revelation.   
You know, in a similar way, in the New Testament, in the four gospels, Jesus asked 315 questions. You won't find that by looking up in a concordance. You actually just have to read the gospels and highlight every time there's a question that Jesus asked. So I did that. 315 questions, 115 of them are binary questions. That means the questions that can be answered with a yes no right, wrong, black, white, that's one of two given answers. Well that means 200 of the questions are open-ended questions. They're complex questions that allow the, the one who's being asked the question to think deeply.   
Sometimes we write after some of those questions say, oh, that is just, you know, Jesus knew the answer. But it's not just that Jesus knew the answers, he needed people to think for themselves. Like, questions like, why do you call me Lord but do not do what I say? Oh, why are you afraid? Why are you worried? Why? And Jesus asked, you know, if all those questions about a third of them are “why?” questions to help you dig deep and understand the motives of the heart, the reasons of the mind. These kind of questions help you discover, discover yourself, discover God, discover Truth, and leads us into a process of open-ended learning.   
So let's learn to be good guestion-askers.  
You know, sometimes, early on in my life, I would, someone would attend a lecture and I would say, did you like the lecture? And they say, yes or no. This is a binary question. And that was the end of the conversation. And I learned then to try to imitate Jesus, and the majority of my questions to be open-ended to say, well that lecture, what did you like about it? What was most meaningful to you? How would this make a difference in your life? And those kind of questions \- the how, the what, the why \- they open up a world of discovery, a world of dialogue, a world of learning. So let's learn to ask questions, good questions, open-ended questions one of another and encouraging each other to growth and learning.   
Now Jesus did what he did was very appropriate in the Jewish culture of where he lived. I've had many Jewish friends over the years and noticed that they have been really good question askers. So one day I asked one of my Jewish friends, can you tell me why do you Jews, like to ask so many questions? And he answered me, why not? Let's keep asking the questions.

**Education Sphere 32: Question Asking And Implicational Thinking.**   
We're gonna be reading from Genesis 18:23-33. I'm gonna read selections from this passage. This is the encounter between Abraham and God, and Abraham's intercession for Sodom and Gomorrah. It is the longest conversation that God has with anyone in the book of Genesis. Abraham approached God and said, will you sweep away both the righteous and the wicked? Suppose… (now he's, he's doing a caseload study.) Okay, suppose you find 50 righteous people living there in the city — will you still sweep it away and not spare it for their sake? Surely you wouldn't do such a thing, destroying the righteous along with the wicked. Why, you would be treating the righteous and the wicked exactly the same\! Surely you wouldn't do that. Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right? And then God answers him and says, no, I wouldn't do that…   
And then he goes on and says, …Suppose there are only 45 righteous people rather than 50? …Suppose there're only 40… Let me speak again. Suppose only 30 righteous people… since I dare to speak to the Lord, let me continue— Suppose there are only 20?… suppose only 10 are found there? And the Lord replied, then I will not destroy it for the sake of 10\.   
So when we are in a place of learning in discipleship, and education it’s so much more than just learning facts, it's how to connect the facts, how to analyze and think. True education is not about learning data and acquiring data and information. True learning is about learning how to learn, how to really ask questions, how to compare. It's not just knowing the capital cities of each nation, but how do we think? How do we grow in our thinking?   
Suppose, suppose, suppose, suppose. Abraham is asking God. He's trying to understand. And what he's doing in this analysis, is you compare similar things and dissimilar things. Two things that are like each other is called a comparison. Two things that are not like each other is called a contrast. He says, you can't treat two people who are different in the same way. It doesn't, it doesn't work. It's not just, it's not right.   
So learning to follow a thread of thought until its final conclusion, when you grab a hold of something. Abraham had an understanding of what was just and he started with 50 and then went to 40 and then 30 and 20 and 10\. What if he continued a little bit more? Each time God said, I will not destroy… I will not destroy… I will not destroy… He was not like the gods of the pagan Canaanites who had to be appeased, who were always trying to find an excuse to destroy their worshipers. Our God is a life giver.   
So good education, learning about learning how to think; following up good question is where the doorway of great discovery.   
Let me tell you a personal story. Some years ago, almost three decades ago, I was teaching at a school of biblical studies in YWAM in Cape Town, South Africa. And they'd invited me to speak on the book of Romans. And at that time I was doing my master's thesis on the role of women in leadership. And I’d been looking at the difficult passages that sometimes are cited in by Paul in 1Corinthians 11, 1Corinthians 14, and 1Timothy 2\. And so I'd been spending hours and hours in those passages. But now I was tasked with teaching through the book of Romans.   
And as I'm reading through that book in preparing to teach, I come to chapters 9, 10, 11; it talks about, uh, God's encounter with Rebecca and how He promises that she will have two children, that He has chosen the younger to rule over the older. That thought is the foundational thought for all of those three chapters. And Paul built this understanding, the history of revelation on the word of God that came through a woman.   
I went to bed that night with that going through my head and thinking, how crazy is it? People have said that Paul refused to have women teach, but he builds his whole teaching of church history on the principle that came to us by God through the agency of a woman. Wow. I fell asleep thinking about that. And in the middle of the night I was awakened with a thought. I believe it was God who was speaking to me. And sometimes I love it when God, when we have questions and God answers our questions. But I think I find it even more exciting at times when God pauses and asks us questions and challenges us to come up with the answers. And that night I woke up with a thought that had never been through my mind before. It was like if that word came through a woman, what other parts of the Bible came only through a woman? And would you be willing to take those parts of the Bible out? Because if you're not supposed to receive teaching from a woman, any part of the Bible that came through a woman should be cut out from the Bible, if that is indeed what the scriptures are saying.   
Wow, that was an interesting thought. But in order to answer that question, I had to, like Abraham, had to pull through the threads.   
So I got myself a new Bible and I read through it and every time there was a passage where there was only a woman speaking, I would highlight it. And I found that there were 886 verses that the only explanation is that they came through a woman. You know, versus like when Elizabeth and Mary are together and, and they worship God for the miraculous birth that both of them are going to be experiencing in Luke chapter two. Or when Rebecca and Leah are arguing about who's gonna sleep with the husband Jacob that night in Genesis. And there are passages were only, uh, there's no man within shouting distance. And they come through the scripture. So very conservative.   
So I made a list, but then I thought maybe I missed it. So I said, I will read the Bible again. So I did it a second time and then I thought, well I still might have missed it. So I got a another time and did it a third time. And I did that each time with a new Bible because I did not wanna be influenced by, by what I seen before. And that last time I asked four friends to join me, I gave them each a Bible. I said, would you mark these passages? Now, I had seven Bibles that have been read through and marked with passages that only could only have come to us through women.   
That's how I, you know, that takes about a hundred. If you're just reading the Bible from cover to cover, it's only 72 hours in English. But if you're pausing and highlighting maybe a hundred hours. So it's somewhere between 500 and 700 hours between myself and my friends trying to find the scriptural evidence to answer the question that God gave us, that gave me that night. And 866 verses, that's more than the Gospel of John. That's more than Romans and first Corinthians put together. There's no way we'd cut those passages out of the Bible. God speaks through women.   
But how did that happen? Hearing a question, pursuing an answer and hanging on, analyzing and thinking and reflecting and continuing on until you go, Like, oh, this is God's ways.   
Friends, if we're gonna change society, if we're gonna be a blessing to the communities of which we are giving an alternate to the corrupt ways that we live in today's age, we're gonna have to think deeply. We're gonna have to search the scriptures profoundly. We're gonna have to love intensely. And we're gonna have to persevere and not give up until we get the answers from the heart of God.

**Education Sphere 33: Cultivate Critical Thinking.** 

This comes from Leviticus 10:10-11. You must distinguish between what is sacred and what is common, between what is ceremonially unclean and what is clean. And you must teach the Israelites all the decrees that the Lord has given them through Moses.

When we say critical thinking, we don't mean negativity, like finding out what's bad about someone. What it means to think, what is the critical issue here? What is the important, essential or central issue? It's about cultivating discernment, about being, ask, ask the question that you're able to distinguish between contrasting points of view and be able understand and go, well, this and that aren't the same. And you can't have both of these things, or they are the same being able to think through thoughtfully and evaluate and discern.

**Education Sphere 34: Guard Your Heart.**   

Proverbs 4:20-23.  My child pay attention to what I say, listen carefully to my words. Don’t lose sight of them. Let them penetrate deep into your heart… Love that. Let them penetrate deep into your heart. … for they bring life to those who find them and healing to the whole body. Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.

Friends, we have to watch what goes into our heart and what comes out of our heart. When you program computers, they say GIGO \-garbage in garbage out. If you're feeding your mind and your heart all the time with garbage, garbage is going to come out. Let's, let's discipline our minds to take in that which is godly and righteous and beneficial, in every area to learn of the ways of God in creation, in science and mathematics and literature and whatever area to learn of his ways. And to allow his excellence to then be rooted in our hearts, His character, His ways.

**Education Sphere 35: Love Good and Hate Evil.** 

Proverbs 9:10. This fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom. Knowledge of the Holy One results in good judgment.

This echoes what we see in Proverbs 8:13 that all who fear the Lord will hate evil. So education \- we’re being trained to discern to have critical thinking. So it's not just that we can assess, but we can devote ourselves to the good and run away, shun, avoid the evil. That is, that is what God has called us to do.

**Education Sphere 36: Faith. Virtue. Knowledge.** 

This comes from 2 Peter 1:5-8. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith, goodness, or virtue or character, depending on your translation and to goodness, virtue of character knowledge and to knowledge self-control and to self-control perseverance and to perseverance godliness, and to godliness mutual affection and to mutual affection. Love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure… Look at this promise. If you possess these qualities of increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Do you want to be fruitful? Do you want to be effective? You want to be productive? Then grow in faith, in virtue, in knowledge, and self-control, in perseverance, and godliness, affection, and love. 

This order is significant. To your faith add virtue. And then knowledge. Sometimes when we think of education the goal is to get to know more, is we focus on the cognitive head stuff. But it says to faith first, add virtue, goodness, moral character. We need to be shaped, in our hearts and then trained in our mind and develop skills for our hands. When we do those together, then we will be effective and productive.

This passage is foundational for the University of the Nations, YWAM's university I'm involved with. And that's why the way we get into this university is not by passing an entrance exam that tests your knowledge. You do a Discipleship Training School that develops your character. And that character development is more important than the mere acquisition of knowledge.

True education is discipleship. It's about bringing in transformation in the whole person. Sometimes education is kind of like a watermelon on a stick. The head gets big and round and the rest of the body and the rest of your life is undeveloped and scrawny like a little stick-man, a little pole-man, but with as big watermelon size head. That's not God's vision. That we are all in an integrated holistic way developed and head, heart, hands \- all who we are \- grows together in the purposes of God.

**Education Sphere 37: The Role of The Family in Education.**  

Proverbs 3:1-6.  My child never forget the things I've taught you. Store my commands in your heart. If you do this, you will live many years and your life will be satisfying. Never let loyalty and kindness leave you\! Tie them about your neck as a reminder. Write them deep within your heart. Then you'll, then you'll find favor with both God and people, and you will earn a good reputation. Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.

This passage as myriads of other passages throughout scripture, some of which we've already looked at, we see that family is the foundational sphere for which education occurs. Parents are enjoined to teach their children. Children are exhorted to learn from their parents. Family is God's and God's design is the primary place for training the next generation.

**Education Sphere 38: Role of the Church in Education.** 

This is Acts 19:9-10.  He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture halls of Tyrannus. This is Paul when he's in Ephesus on his second missionary journey. This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.

Remember we just said that the family is the foundation for education? Well, the church is the family of God. So by extension through implicational, critical thinking, we can realize that as the family of God, they also have a key role to intentionally participate in the formation of new members who are born into the fellowship of believers. So this is a role that's shared and built upon what family does.

**Education Sphere 39: Role of the School and Education.**  

1 Chronicles 27:32 is talking about some of the people who worked in various occupations in David's palace when he was King.  Jonathan, David's uncle was a wise counselor to the king, a man of great insight and a scribe. Jehiel the Hacmonite was responsible for teaching the king's son.

The tutor, the teacher. We're to celebrate the many people who are called to the vocation of teaching. It's a high calling. Because it's so important for our children to grow up in the ways of God, to grow with understanding, discover their gifts, understand how God's designed them and what the intents and purposes He has for their life, to develop that legacy  —we just need, we need many other people supporting the family, supporting the church in that process. And so that God calls many to be teachers and we need to see a revival of this at this time. This is a high calling. It's a spiritual calling. It's a significant calling. When you, when you are teaching the next generation preschool, elementary, or high school, you making a difference, not just for today, but for years to come.

**Education Sphere 40: Support Good Teachers.** 

This comes from 3 John 1 there is only one chapter in 1John. Verses:6-8. …Please send them on the way in a manner that honors God. It was for the sake of the name that they went out receiving no help from the pagans. We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.

Who is he talking about? Traveling teachers, missionaries who are preaching and teaching the gospel and who are informing people about the character and ways of God. And so the context of this exhortation, in fact, this little book could be called, entitled, open the door, you know, to get hospitality, to traveling teachers.

And that's in contrast to 2 John, which is the letter just before that you could entitle “close the door” because there are some bad teachers, some false teachers that were traveling and say, you know, don't even feed them a meal, don’t let them stay in your house, don’t give them any money. Because if you do, you participate in that. But when there are good teachers give them hospitality, support them financially. This was the exhortation in the early church.

For today, for our application, as we need to support financially, those who are involved with us in teaching our children, who are using their teaching gifts to advance good in our communities. And it's a meritorious task and it deserves to be supported in every way you can with encouragement, with prayers, and with finances.

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**

Now the next six passages are going to have key elements of Biblical Education. And the language might sound unusual to you if you're not a teacher, but if you're a trained educator, you're go like, huh, I get it\! Because these next passages talk about Bloom's Taxonomy. What is that? Well, you can look it up on Google and get all kinds of information, but it's an educational framework that helps people understand the process of development, of how we grow in our knowledge in the educational process. This taxonomy was developed in the 20th century by Mr. Bloom and colleagues. It rings true because it reflects principles that we find in scripture and that we experience in the reality of day-to-day educational experiences.

One of the things that's important in this process of discipling the nations, we have to sphere appropriate language to bring discipleship and transformation, biblical transformation into that language. So we don't use religious language in the educational sphere. We use educational language. So if this is seems unusual to you, well, it's not, if you're an educator, so join us on this journey. And I hope this will be inspirational to you.

See, Bloom's taxonomy talks about six different areas. It talks about remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. It’s usually pictured it as a pyramid. And the remembering is at the foundation, is the basics. And as you grow, you are able to master a subject matter until you can create into something totally new with that. All six of these steps in the educational process are abundantly evidenced in the scripture. So we'll take a look at some of them and see how applicable the word of God is to this sphere.

**Education Sphere 41: is Remembering.** 

Deuteronomy 4:10, never forget the day \- Remember \- when you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Sinai, where he told me, Summon the people before me, and I will personally instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live and they will teach their children to fear me also.

So Remembering has to do with recalling basic facts and concepts. You have to know the data. If you don't have that, you can't grow in your knowledge. So yes, you do have to memorize important dates in your country's history, the big events. Those are important things to do. You do need to know facts and data. Remembering God's work in our past, equips us to fear Him in the present and prepares us to teach our children in the future. Remembering has past, present and future implications. So its really important.

**Education Sphere 42: Understanding.** 

Haggai 2:18 says, think about this 18th day of December, the day when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid. Think carefully.

Think carefully. Haggai is a fun prophet. He's a, just a handful of short prophecies and every single one of them, he dates. He's the only prophet who does this. He knows exactly the moment when God said this thing, when this particular thing happened. So he's remembering the big thing that happened. So Haggai lives at the same time as Zechariah, and Nehemiah, and Ezra, so those four books all kind of go together. And the big thing was that the temple began to be rebuilt on this day. And so you need to understand what God was doing. That's what think carefully, understand the Bible, being able to explain ideas or concepts. This is why this was going on. This was why it is significant. This is why it is important. So think carefully Ponder on your experience and gain insight. That's that's an important part. You got to know the facts, but then you have to work the facts and gain, understanding.

**Education Sphere 43: (Applying)**

For our **43rd** key passage Applying. 1 Corinthians 14:35. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home.

Oh my goodness. This is a talking about women were speaking in church and it sounds like a slap in the face until you get the context. In that day, women were not allowed education. There was no educational opportunity, not for Roman women, not for Greek women, not for Jewish women. In fact, rarely did men and women even worship together. In all of the pagan religions, they're usually just religions for men or religions for women and the religion that had men and women together usually had a lot of sexual kind of activities going on. Not exactly what we wanted to see happen in the Church. 

So as they were coming together, this is the first time this was a religious experience where men and women are worshiping God, the true God in a new way. There was no reference point. Even among the Jewish people, in the synagogues, the men worshiped in one part of the building and the women were relegated to either the back or the balcony, and were not part of the worship. They were observers from a distance. So this was something totally new in that era. 

Because the women had never had an opportunity for education, things could arise in the church. They were illiterate. They couldn't read so many of these things. They would not understand something. So some of them like those question asking, going on a lot of confusion and just not knowing how to do the process right.

And so Paul says, if they want to inquire about something, that's a good thing. They want to understand what this is about. And then it says they should ask their own husbands at home. What is significant here is this the first time in human history, by implication, that husbands are enjoined to make sure their wives have the same educational opportunity that they have. This is the first time there's an instruction in any literature of any philosophy of any religion in that part of the world that says, you are to invest time in educating a female. And that is a remarkable thing because husbands now have responsibility, they had to apply this. There was, there was something to be done. They were to talk about it here and we get some, they didn't have the full understanding. Remember where we go from the memory to understanding that they had set up a teaching situation in an appropriate place to continue to grow and cultivate this ability. This is the first opportunity. And this leaves applying always about using information in new situations. Wow, this was a new situation. Women had never been offered the equal opportunity in education until the gospel of Jesus came.

**Education Sphere 44: Analyzing**   
Job 42:7. After the Lord had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite: I'm angry with you and your two friends, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has.   
Analysis is to look at the difference between those things that are different from one another or can see those things that are similar to one another. Drawing conclusions, contrasting and comparing ideas. This is what God is doing in, in speaking to Eliphaz in this passage of Job. And God's a thoughtful God. He's a thinking God and he invites us to be imitators of him in this process.   
We see this not only in the Book of Job, but very from the very beginning in Genesis one. Every day that God creates, he stands back at the end of the day, looks at what he has made, he analyzes it, he gives it nomenclature. He calls the light day in the darkness night, and then he considers what he's done and he says, it is good. It is good. There's an evaluation, a reflection, a pausing, a learning. And that that is something very powerful. And that's in the scripture to model for us. When we are in the process of growth, we create something new, we stand back, we reflect, we pause, we consider, we analyze and we draw conclusions.   
Remember when we are looking at the process of education, the apex of Bloom's taxonomy that we're going through at this point is creativity. And so this analysis is an essential part for creativity to happen. That's why this passage in Genesis one is so important.

**Education Sphere 45\. Evaluating.** 

We are reading Numbers 36:1-12. Now, I am just reading a summary of this. It's about an unusual situation that happened. This, this passage is actually recorded in five different passages. This situation that we're going to read about just keeps coming up again and again, because the law is that the inheritance goes through the male in the family line in, in the Jewish culture. But there was this one man, Zelophehad,  who only had daughters. And so since he had no sons, it meant that there was no one to pass on the land, the inheritance, and that family, that whole clan would lose their property rights. And so they had to say, well, this is the law, but this is an unusual circumstance. What do we do here? And so they make an adjustment and so they start applying that adjustment. 

And then there's another problem because if the ladies, the daughters marry outside of the tribe, then the land and in next generation becomes, when there is a man there, it goes to another tribe. So now we've made an exception, but we need to qualify that exception. 

So you see this whole story, that first emerges in number 26, then in Numbers 27, gets revisited in Numbers 36 which we will read here, then picks up again in Joshua 17 and 1 Chronicles 7\. And this story keeps developing because they are evaluating. They're trying to figure out how to make all these principles mesh together in a way that no injustice is done and that good is established for all. You have to work the truth.

So let me read this. Then the heads of the clans of Gilead \- descendants of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph \-  came to Moses and then family leaders of Israel with a petition...  daughters as Zelophehad had did as the Lord commanded Moses macula, Tirzah Ola Milka and Noah, all married cousins on their father's side. They married into the clans of Manasseh, son of Joseph. Thus their inheritances of land remained within their ancestral tribe.

So they carry the inheritance, but they married within the tribe. And so the next generation, everyone was happy.

To evaluate is to justify a stand or a posture or a decision. I'm taking this stand. And this is why, and you can explain it. You can validate it, that's what is going on here. And they're working this out as a new nation, trying to figure out how they're going to do this. And it's a wonderful example of really a multi-year, even a multi-generational process of trying to understand the ways of God and applying them in a way that is just and fair and kind to everyone in that society. We were all invited to do the same.

**Education Sphere 46: (Create)**

The last stage, the educational process. If you've rightly remembered and understood and applied and analyzed and evaluated that now you are ready to Create.  Psalm 98:1 says, Sing a new song to the Lord, for he has done wonderful deeds. His right hand has won a mighty victory; His holy arm has shown is saving power\!

Sing a new song, produce a new or original work. That's creativity. Do something that's never been done before\! A new song is one of many things that could be done. And they are writing a new song, because they have fresh insight into who God is. He's done a new work in their midst. They're reflecting on that. They remember the facts. They've understood why he's doing it. They've evaluated. They've done all of these things and now we get it. And we're able to write a new song and everyone can participate. That's the culmination of this learning process, in this situation. It's a release of creativity.

True education doesn't confine people and put them into boxes. It doesn't, it doesn't churn out students like you turn out cars on an assembly line. It doesn't equip you to be ticky- tacky, matching little people-ettes. It allows people to develop their full potential and become the creative beings made in the image of God that they were intended to be.

We see this in the story of Revelation. They sing new songs even in heaven. It means that there's going to be education going on in heaven. If we're singing new songs in heaven, people are going to be writing those songs. And we'll be learning those songs, we'll be practicing those songs. It's exciting.

I remember as an eight or nine year old, as I was growing up as the son of missionaries in the high Andes mountains of Bolivia in South America, I had a Sunday school teacher who would often speak about the book of Revelation. She would get really excited about it. And I wasn't so sure. So one of her favorite passages, she talked about Revelation 4:6-11, and how they were worshiping God in heaven and talks about these 24 elders and these four living creatures and \- it was kind of like spooky to me, because these living creatures had all these wings and their eyes all over the wings on the inside and outside. And she explained that meant they saw a lot. They understood a lot. Of all the beings, they were the most intelligent beings in all the universe. And then it says in verse eight that they sing a song, holy, holy, holy is the Lord our God who was and is, and as it is to come. And they did that day and night forever and ever. 

Now I was eight and I thought, these are the most intelligent beings in the universe and they have this one song with just a few words that they sing over and over again, day and night for ever and ever. That sounds really boring. And I was quite determined that I did not want to participate in such activity. Fortunately God changed my heart years on. And I found that there was great reason, but I still didn't understand why this what's going on?

And as a young adult, I had the privilege of going to London. And while there are visited the, the tower where the crown jewels are held. And there's a scepter there, there are all these crowns and just is it's the wealth, the Royal wealth of the greatest empire on the history of the world, are in this museum. And as the scepter that has the star of Africa. And it's just thousands of facets, and its on the stand that the pivots, and the bright lights, it just sparkles and gleams. And that its is every color imaginable. Its dynamic and fluid. It is breathtaking. You just gasp when you see it \- just never seen anything like it. 

And I was a young man and I was thinking about getting married and had enough money to buy a tiny little diamond for my wife’s engagement ring. And I was looking at this and I've never seen anything so beautiful. This is not things that guys usually think about. And so when we, as an happens in all good museums in the west, you've finished a tour and there’s the gift shop. So I said, I'm going to buy a postcard and show my friends what a beautiful thing this diamond was. And I find the postcard and I get this thing, and I look at it. And I was looking with great excitement, but my face drops with disappointment when I look at it, because this is not what I saw. What I saw was something moving and ever-changing and the light was sparkling and it was turquoises and golds and silvers and just greens and, and violets and just all these different colors coming out of it. It was always moving and dynamic. And the postcard was fixed flat and static and cold. I thought, my friends already think I'm crazy. If I sent this picture saying the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, they’ll say We know he's crazy now. So I didn’t buy the postcard. 

On the way home God said, Do you remember your questions about Revelation four that you had as an eight year old? I said, yeah. He said, you spend most of your life looking at Me and all you’ve seen is a postcard of Me, a very poor and limited representation. But these elders, they spend the whole time in My presence. And every time they throw their crowns before Me and worship, they recover. They sit back in their 24 thrones, they lift up their eyes, and they see something new about Me, a new dimension of My love, a new aspect of My faithfulness, a new reality about My justice, or My kindness. And that revelation leads them to a new song. It's an ever changing song, and the word Holy holy holy really could mean unique. Awesome. One of a kind, spectacular.” Wow. They're just like, there is always fresh revelation. There's never been a song sung twice exactly the same way in His presence because this learning is of continuous discovery, more and more of the wonders of our God. 

And it's in anticipation of that eternal learning in His presence and that worship that creative dynamic, life giving worship that will be in His presence, that we develop our educational systems today to lead us toward that same process. And it will never be boring, never old and always life-giving.

**Crossover Passages**

As with every sphere, the final six passages are looking at how this sphere of education crosses over with the other six spheres. So let's look at that together.

**Education Sphere 47: Education and Family.** 

Deuteronomy 11:19 says, Teach them to your children (the laws, the ways of God). Talk about them when you are at home and when you're on the road, when you're going to bed, and when you're getting up.

As we've seen multiple times in this process, family is the place where education is supposed to happen. These two work closely, hand in hand, and that's rightly so. And so, as you consider in your society, how involved is family in their education with their children? How are they educating their children? Are they teaching them the ways of God? The principles of God? How are they working in that next generation?

**Education Sphere 48: Education and Economics.** 

Paul here is writing to one of his disciples, Titus, about false teachers that are doing harm in the church. It says They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach. That’s bad education. And that for the sake of dishonest gain They are trying to make a buck doing that. And they shouldn't there it's, it's corrupt. The content of the material is corrupt. The processes corrupt. The way they're profiting off of this is corrupt. So inappropriate financial charges for educational activities should be avoided. We need to have good biblical content and good biblical processes by which those are done. We need the economic area to help support and finance and facilitate education, but we do this in collaborative ways, knowing that it can go bad on either side and we need to work to have everything right in both of these spheres that they partner together.

**Education Sphere 49: Education and Government.** 

This comes from 2 Kings 12:2.  All his life Joash did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight because Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

This is very interesting. Joash was a king of Judah and he was actually spared. Jehoiada protected him because the one that before him who ruled was Athaliah, the queen, who was a usurper of the throne, that really came from Israel in the north. So he was protected and put on the throne. And as long, as long as Jehoiada was around, and when he was under the mentorship, the tutelage of Jehoiada things went really well. When the priest died, Joash ended up killing Jehoiada's son, and then he went off the rails. He went south, he turned away from God and all kinds of things happened and he ended up being assassinated. 

So it was a story of that was the first half of his reign was really good. And the latter part was very disastrous. We learned something here \- the religious role can influence the other roles. The religious sphere can influence the government sphere or other spheres, and to bring educational insight into the government space. Notice that Jehoiada didn't take on a governmental function. As a priest he did what it was supposed to do \-- to teach the ways of God.

So we can train people as followers of Jesus and in the spheres, in areas that we're not involved with as religious, Levitical or missionary people in that sphere. We can train people and other spheres without engaging in those spheres directly ourselves. Jehoiada remained faithful to in his religious role throughout his life. And it's served Joash well in his governmental role. 

This shows how sometimes we think we should try to keep religion out of government. We should keep forced religion out of government. That's the whole purpose of the separation of church and state that you don't impose or require or obligate people to believe in one way or another, because that is a personal choice. But we don't ever want to keep God out of any sphere. And the religious, when it’s working well can help teach government and every other sphere, how to bring God and his ways appropriately into that sphere. That is not manipulative. That is not destructive. That is not oppressive. That is life-giving and brings blessing to the nation.

**Education Sphere 50: Education and Religion.** 

This comes from chapter eight of Nehemiah verses two to three, and then seven to eight. …Ezra the priest brought the Book of the Law before the assembly… (Again, probably the book of Deuteronomy) which included the men and women and all the children old enough to understand. He faced the square, just inside of the Water Gate from early morning until noon and read aloud to everyone who could understand. All the people listened closely to the Book of the Law…. The Levites… then instructed the people in the Law, while everyone remained in their places. They read from the Book of the Law of God and clearly explained the meaning of what was being read, helping the people understand each passage.

Like family and education, religion and education are to be collaborative. Here, the Levites \- Ezra what was the priest \- and the Levites, as they read the law, helped explain helped bring understanding. This is a context where the majority of the people would have been illiterate. They wouldn't have access to the, the documents themselves because those are prized possession with only a few copies of these scrolls. And so, as they heard, they would have questions and they needed to be unpacked and explained. So religion and education are to be rightly linked together that this Levitical role, this priestly role, this religious function can serve in an educational way to bless the people of the whole city or clan or tribe or nation.

**Education Sphere 51: Education and Media Communication.** 

Mark 4:33-34. with many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. 

Wow. He did not say anything without using a parable.

This is a literary art form. It was appropriate media communication for his day. It was entertaining. It was story. It was dynamic. It was engaging. Jesus was a great communicator. And so he used the media of his day, the means that were available to him, to educate, to teach, to train. Jesus used all the creative means at his disposal and to communicate with the crowds and then notice how he says he then got alone with the disciples and further explained to them. He does a second round, a deeper dive with his disciples as they are in a private place, away from the crowds. So Jesus was using all these various styles of communication.

**Education Sphere 52: Education and Celebration.** 

This is Psalm 60: the title that comes in front verse one. So in our English Bibles, there parts of the original text that are instructions about the psalm that we don't include in our verses, but they are part of the Bible. In other languages like in German, this is actually verse one.

So for the choir director: a psalm of David useful for teaching regarding that time David fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and killed 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. To be sung to the tune “Lily of the Testimony.”

You know, the tune, it goes like, oh, it's okay.

The psalm was written with a didactic purpose. It was useful for teaching. It wasn't just to, for beauty sake, though it is aesthetically attractive, it was educationally significant. And we can use the arts educationally. In fact, the arts are some of the best ways to communicate the deepest truths. When you engage someone with a story of God, with a story of how things look in a sphere when its being done right. With engaging stories, where there's drama and climax and resolutions and redemption and conflict and all of these things, those stories and the visuals that either made in your imagination or on a screen or in a painting, those things all help us in our educational process.

We have to remember that people learn in many different ways and the arts help us advance the educational impact. So these two spheres should collaborate very frequently with one another. 

**Final thoughts**

As we've looked at all of this, we can see that education is connected to each of the spheres. There's a place for them to collaborate at every level. And I pray that as you continue to think and pray about the sphere of education, God will lead you how to grow in this area yourself and bring about educational transformation in your society that reflects the kingdom of God and advance is his purposes.



**Communications Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader  
June 2023

**Communications/Media Sphere Introduction**  
We now have the opportunity to look together at the sphere of **media communication.** Through media, God desires the transfer wisdom and the promotion of healthy relationships. Proverbs is full of pithy sayings, which emphasize the power of communication to do good or to do ill. There's great power, not only what is said, but in how it is said. Today with new media technologies emerging all the time, we have more capacity to communicate than ever before. But what are we communicating? How are we communicating? Is it bringing life or death? We should engage in media as followers of Jesus to advance the ways of the kingdom of God. Communicating always truth and love. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This first section has to do with God and the Sphere of Media Communication. These six passages will highlight God as the most incredible Communicator in the universe. He is incomparable, and the way he communicates is a model for us and how we should communicate, whether that's in our personal relationships or in the societal sphere of media and communication. 

**Communication Sphere 1: God's Ways Are Diverse.**   
The passage we're looking at comes from 1 Chronicles 28:19 says this: Every part of this plan, David told Solomon, was given to me in writing from the hand of the Lord. 

God is a great communicator. And his methods of communication are many. Three times in the Original Testament we are told that God wrote. This was when he wrote the 10 commandments. It was his own hand which inscribed those words on the stones. We’re told in Exodus 34:28 and, and Moses repeats it at least three times in the book of Deuteronomy. He didn't chisel those words into the stone. God's finger, God's hand wrote those himself. We also had this passage from David that God wrote the temple blueprint. It was God's words and he gave it to him in writing. Wow, that's amazing communication. He didn't just hear it from God, and then, and then record what he had heard. God communicated in written form. 

We also can remember when Daniel was in front of Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon and, he had been using the artifacts of the temple to worship idols, and God was not pleased with that. And God's hand appears in, in human form, starts writing on the wall and everyone was amazed and shocked and Belshazzar called Daniel in to come and explain that. So we have at least three instances in the Original Testament where God writes. And of course in John 8:6, when the woman caught an adultery is brought before Jesus, he too, stoops down and writes in the sand. What exactly we don't know, but we know that he does what his father has always done. 

Now, God is a great communicator. Hebrews 1:1 says that God spoke many times. And in many ways. And writing is just one of the ways that God's has communicated. If we go through the scriptures, the methodologies employed by God seem endless. He speaks through angels. That's pretty awesome. He speaks through a donkey. That's pretty astounding. He speaks through dreams and visions and prophets and signs. He uses a pillar of cloud in the day and a column of fire at night to communicate his intentions. He speaks through creation. We read about this in Romans one, that through what God has made, we can know about his attributes, his eternal power and his divine nature. And in Psalm 19 talks about how the heavens are telling of the glory of God. And he communicates through the things that he's made his, like the creation is his fingerprint. We can look at it and understand truths about who God is. And he speaks through a still, small voice. There's so many different ways that God has spoken. He's the communicator **par excellance**. 

Now God speaks, or he commands or he promises, or he tells, there's a variety of synonyms, of verbs that communicate God's communication. And of all the things that God does that are recorded in the Bible, the thing that he most frequently does is he communicates. This is the top number one, verb action of God. And is the most repeated thing. Now, this is interesting because when people talk about, well, I heard God speak, or God spoke to me. People go like, oh, that's something really unusual. That's odd. Are you sure it was God, aren't you a little bit crazy? But actually in the Bible, when God isn't speaking, that's when it's odd. We read in 1 Samuel 3:1 the author writes with astonishment …now in those days, messages from the Lord were very rare and visions were quite uncommon. That was not normative. Normative is that God, this wonderful communicator, is always reaching out to us. It's not a problem about God speaking. The issue is, are we listening? 

**Communication Sphere 2: God's Ways Are Appropriate.**   
Hebrew 1:1-2. Long ago God spoke many times in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets. And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son, he created the universe. 

God's communication is always time appropriate. We read in Isaiah 28:10, how his instructions, his teaching is line up online. it says he tells us everything over and over. Like, don't you love it? Because he, he doesn’t tire of communicating with us. I often don't get it the first time I hear from God or the first time I read the scriptures, I need to be taught over and over again, but he says one line at a time, one line at a time, a little here and a little there. He gives to us, he communicates with us as we are able to receive it, as it's time appropriate, and we can handle and we can apply and understand. 

His appropriateness is not just doing the right ‘what’ the right content or the right time. But even the right, ‘how’, his means of communicating. We need to pay attention to the, how he speaks, not just the ‘what’ he speaks. This is the same message of God's love and God's redemption. God's desire to forgive and reconcile human beings to himself was the same message all through the Original Testament and the New Testament. It's what the prophets spoke of. It's what the law was purposed for. It's what the scripture's all about. But even though that message was there and constantly present, it didn't fully land, we didn't really get it, until God himself came in the person of Jesus, became incarnate and lived amongst us. And how he communicated, the fact that he became one of us, that ‘how’ that sacrifice, that incredible effort to make his message understood, not just that words about his love, but a demonstrable practical lived out love in our midst \-that ‘how’ changes us because Jesus came. 

In these final days. He has spoken to us through his son. This ‘how’ is the means of our salvation. 

**Communication Sphere 3: God's Content Is True.**   
1 Thessalonians 5:19-21, Paul writes Do not stifle the Holy Spirit. Do not scoff at prophecies, but test everything that is said. Hold onto what is good. 

The fact that God communicates truth is so very important. God's truth is constant and it's normal. We live in an age where skepticism is rampant, where everyone doubts the existence of objective truth. And everyone seeks their own truth. Well, whatever you feel or I feel or you think, or I think doesn't make \- our feelings and our thoughts don't make that thing true or not true. It's true apart from our existence, it's true because it matches reality. And God's truth, God's communication is always true. 

Let me just reflect some passages with you. Proverbs 30:5: Every word of God proves true… His commandments are right. They, when we live according to them, they prove true. Life is better that way. His promises are true when we trust him and he, he fulfills them. We can see he's trustworthy. His every word proves true. 

Isaiah 45:19 God is speaking. And he says: … I, the Lord speak only what is true and declare only what is right. Are you looking for what is true and right in your life? Look to God. He's the only one who can guarantee that always its true, always its right. And when we think about this sphere, we need to model our actions after this action of God. 

Jesus, when he was before Pilate on the, at the time of just before his crucifixion said this in John 18:37, …actually, I was born and came into this world to testify to the truth. All who love the truth recognized that what I say is true. 

When I was in university, I was in a dorm that was, you had applied to get into was kind of the, the college nerds, from the different fields they got together. Our dorm was different. This was secular university. Other dorms on weekends would have keggers and parties with beer and stuff. And in our dorm we would have wine and cheese parties. We were kind of very elite, very snobbish actually. And there were just a few of us, two or three of us who were followers of Jesus in that dorm. And we had all kind of different events that we ran. And so I thought at one point, I'm gonna do a study of 1 John with my colleagues. And so we set up five, a series of five days so that we can read a chapter and we've just read it and then talk about it. And the way I pitched it was this letter is foundational to Western civilization. So let's read about it.

So I'm having a Bible study, but it's not a Bible study, it’s a literature study because you know, 95% of the people there are non-believers. And so I remember one day, because in 1 John it talks a lot about truth, one of the most brilliant guys on campus who was studying philosophy and you know, always on the Dean's list. I asked him and the others gathered there- Now what if all these comments that John is making about truth? What if they are really are objectively true? And this is how he answered. He said, well, I've dedicated my life to the search of truth. So I don't want to know if this is really true or not. Because if I find out that it's true, then my purpose of life is over. I won't have anything to search after. 

What? Are you kidding me? The world plays so many games with truth. They speak about truth, but avoid it when it brings any implications or consequences on their life. We, as followers of Jesus need to know there's a constant truth and we have to discover it as we listen to God, as we walk in his ways, we need to be a people who are consequential in applying that truth to our life. We don't try to shape the Bible to match our world. We need to shape our world to match what the Bible says. 

Finally, in the these passages you can see and Acts 14:3, Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey. They say, …and the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders. And 1 Thessalonians 1:5  Paul writes: for when we brought you the Good News, it was not only with words, but also with power, for the Holy Spirit gave you full assurance that what we said was true. God’s mighty acts are confirmations. Those things that are absolutely impossible for the paralyzed to walk, for the dead to rise, for the blind to see —these are confirming signs that this is indeed the true message. 

So finally, 2 Timothy 3:14-16. Paul writes to his protege, Timothy: but you must remember…remain faithful to the things you've been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you. So we can know truth because it, it matches reality. You know, it's true because it's supported by the miraculous confirmation of God. We can know it's true because we can see the lives of the people who've passed us on to us. You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. 

**Communication Sphere 4: God's Content Is Trustworthy.**   
Luke 1:1-4. at the outset of his gospel Luke writes these words, talking about the methodology he employed in order to make sure that what he was writing about we are reading is absolutely reliable. Many people he says, have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us. They used the eyewitness report circulating among us from the early disciples. Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning. I also have decided to write in an accurate account for you, most honorable Theopholius, so you can be certain- certain of the truth of everything you were taught. 

You can count on it. You can rely on it. You can build your life on it. This content is trustworthy. In our world there are many substantial claims that we hear about all the time. You just have to go online or turn on the television or listen to the radio. And, and you know, if you use this toothpaste you become the most popular person in your class. Those are unsubstantiated claims, but not so with God's word. This is not a marketing device. It's not something that's been invented in the boardroom, where people are trying to pitch their own products. This is God's word. It's reliable. It's trustworthy. You can go to the bank with it. It's absolutely true. 

**Communication Sphere 5: God's Communication Is Transformative.**   
Colossians 1:6 says this, This same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world. It is bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives, just as it changed your lives from the day you first heard and understood the truth about God's wonderful grace. 

God's truth is applicable. It changes lives. It was designed to reshape us, to take us wherever we are in our life, with whatever degree of brokenness we have and to make us into who we are always intended to be. Sons and daughters of the Living God. Jesus says this in John 8:31-32 …you are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. 

Allowing God's word to shape your life, to embrace this truth, is a freeing activity. It sets us free from the distortions and confusions and the habits and the addictions and the, and the issues that keep us bound and destroy our relationships. God's word brings transformation. 

**Communication Sphere 6: God's Communication Gives Life.**   
John 20:30-31. The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book. But these are written so that you may continue to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life by the power of his name. 

This message, this communication, this truth of God is, is what gives us life. When we speak of life here, it's more than mere existence. It's more than your heart beating, and your lungs sucking in oxygen. It's about the fullness of life. The full realization of the potential. In John 10:10, Jesus says my purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life or in some translations,  have them experience life more abundantly. We all have some measure of life, but we don't have it to its full. We have not realized the fullest expression imaginable. And Jesus comes to take our life, which sometimes feels very far away from the dreams we've dreamed, the hopes we've yearned after. And he says, I can come and bring a true change. I can give you life that is complete, full, meaningful. That is sustainable. And it gives you value and dignity and worth. 

God's words are designed to do us good. You see, God is a life-Giver, He’s a life-Redeemer. He's a life-sustainer. He's a life-Enhancer. God is all about doing good in your life and my life. And if we’re to communicate like God communicates, then our communication must also give life, and enhance life, restore life. That's what God's purposes are for this sphere. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
In this next section, we're gonna look at God's purposes of communication. Why this sphere is so very important to our life as individuals and to our societies, to our cultures. There are very clear reasons why God has designed communication. You see, he created the world, made us in his image. He's the great communicator. He’s given us the capacity to communicate because he has that. Because communication is the foundation for relationship. Without communication you can't know one another, you can't love one another, you can't trust one another. So communication is foundational to the very essence of who we are as human beings. Beings made in the image of God, beings capable of receiving and giving love, responding to love- both vertically with God and horizontally with one another. Without communication, we can't be human. We can't be who we're intended to be. So understanding this is so essential. When this gets distorted in our society, human existence suffers; when this is done well, then human existence thrives. 

**Communication Sphere 7: Creates Unity Around God's Purpose.**   
That's what communication is designed to do Zephaniah 3:9. Then I will purify the speech of all people, so that everyone can worship the Lord together. 

Our speech needs purification. Our speech is often not as it should be. It needs to be corrected. It needs to be adjusted. It needs to be transformed. And when it is, it allows us to come together. It allows for unity to happen. It creates communion and fellowship, and friendship. When our speech is off, relationships suffer. When our speech is on track, our relationships are as they should be. Contemporary media often thrives around discord. When there is a crisis or a problem or a conflict. Wow. The ratings go up. Everyone who wants to watch this thing play out and see the fight, fight, fight, fight, come. And, and they look excitedly at that, but that's not the way of God. Communication should not be about highlighting discord, but facilitating unity. This does not mean to cover up issues, but to really look at issues in depth so that we can address what is wrong and, and find the way to come together. The goal is creating a sense of common identity, of common purpose or mission in life. A profound harmony that supersedes cultural divisions. 

Paul writes in Romans why he wrote that letter, it wasn't primarily just to do an exposition of his theology. He had a pastoral purpose. He wanted to bring about change. You see, in the church, there were believers who were of Jewish background and others who were of Gentile background. And because of numerous circumstances, they were not worshiping together. They were each in their own separate silos. And he writes in order to help them understand they both have the same problem with sin. They both have the same solution to that problem, grace, through the made possible through Jesus sacrificial life and death on the cross of resurrection. And both are to come together. And so he gives the theology he gives the practice, then he sums up at, toward the very end of his letter this is his heart, May God who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other. 

That's why he writes. He wants the Jewish background believers, and Gentile background believers to live in complete harmony with each other as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus. Then all of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is doing here exactly what Zephaniah had prophesied. He's building his whole theology and practice around helping them come together as one to honor God. 

lf we're communicating well, if we're communicating as we should, it should be strengthening unity across our societies, across our world. And having people come together, not in splitting them apart. When your communication, when your media is augmenting divisions, you're not using the media as it should. When it is helping people understand where there have been problems so they can address them and come together, then God's purposes are being fulfilled. 

**Communication Sphere 8: Creates Life-Enhancing Situations.**   
Proverbs 10:11. The words of the godly are a life giving fountain. The words of the wicked conceal violent intentions. 

As I was getting ready to film this set, I went to the barbershop yesterday, cut my hair. And I walked in and I had a, a lady come and take me through the chair to cut my hair. And she was maybe in little late forties, early fifties. And I asked, how are you doing? She kind of grunted said, are you doing okay? And she, oh, it's just the work. I said, having a bad day? Oh, you know, it's just the work. And you could tell she was, she was doing what she was doing, you know, because she had to get the salary and pay the bills and take care of her family and do the things that people do. And so many people do the work that it’s because they have to, there's not finding joy fulfillment in it. 

So I sat there and she started cutting my hair, and I struck a up a conversation with her. I said, I said, you know, you do something really important. I said, you know, when people come in here or they come in because they don't like the way they look. Their, their hair doesn't look good. And, and by the time you finished in the half hour, you show them the mirror at the end and go \- Wow, I look good. I'm looking great. And you, you, for what you do, you give them a sense of renew sense, worth of value of, of affirmation. And she looked at me said, wow, you know, I haven't thought of that. And I just held up a mirror to her. She would hold up a mirror for me to see how my hair was cut. I held up a mirror to her so you could see her, her life was touching people. 

She'd been doing this for about 30 years. She said asking, do you know how many people you would've touched in those times? The thousands of not thousands. And her eyes grew big. And my communication just enabled her to see that her life mattered. But she was doing more than just getting a paycheck. She was more than just meeting the needs of her family. She was doing good in her community and her society. 

God's words enhance life. And we can do this anywhere, everywhere. It doesn't have to be when you just give a religious message, you can just speak truth and affirmation. Proverbs 18:21 says the tongue can bring death or life. Words are powerful. Use them wisely. You can use the words to enhance life or to tear it down. Jesus said in John 6:63, the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. He comes to enhance our life. Peter, a few verses later responds and affirms that what Jesus said is actually true. He said, you have the words that give eternal life. John 6:68, Jesus has words that give life eternal life. And if we model ourselves after him, our words can be life givers too. 

**Communication Sphere 9: Creates Community and Cultural Uniqueness.**   
This comes from Esther 8:9. So on June 25, the king's secretaries were summoned, and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated. It was sent to the Jews and to the highest officers, the governors and the nobles of all the 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia. The decree was written in the scripts and languages of all the peoples of the empire, including that of the Jews. 

This was a massive communication effort, done by the government to all these distant geographies, to ethno-linguistic diversity with all these languages. And this communication led to action. It allowed the Jews to defend themselves against those who had sought to wipe them out through a total genocide. And this was a, this communication changed the history for this one people. This communication was later immortalized in a common festival. Purim is an opportunity to celebrate God's miraculous intervention, to save the Jews who are about to be exterminated. 

But how did that salvation happen? it happened through the means of the timely and appropriate communication that spoke to their community and gave them a unique response, a common language and a common communication creates a sense of common identity. We are on the same page with one another. We need a common story. We need in every people group, in every nation, every family, every tribe, what is this God storyline? 

We all have brokenness in our storylines, but we can also all have redemption. And God by His Mercy has intervened. And that storyline that we can pass on from one generation to another, as the Jewish people do year after year, when they celebrate Purim and remember how thousands of years ago God saved them from the hands of the Persian oppressors and how He intervened. That story gives identity. It gives a sense of purpose and it passes on values and fosters multi-generational continuity. This is what communication does. Good communication. 

**Communication Sphere 10 : Provides Trustworthy Information.**   
2 Timothy 2:2. You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Now teach them these truths to other trustworthy people who be able to pass them on to others. 

So Paul taught Timothy was to teach somebody else who then pass on and teach another —that’s four generations of passing on communication. One of the beauties of the scriptural record is how very, very honest it is. It's radically honest. It's unlike any other cultural writing because, in most stories, the key players are, tend to be idealized and turned into super heroes. But the key players in the Bible are not fictional characters. They're not these great men and women who always do things right. They've not been made into super heroes. We, we read about them with all their warts and failures and foibles and concerns and fears. We read of Abraham and how he lacked courage. And Jacob's deceitfulness, of Moses's disobedience, of David's moral failure, of Peter's betrayal. And Thomas' doubting, of Paul's murderous past. And yet God worked through these imperfect people. 

When you read these stories, you can get the feel, no one's trying to cover up their pasts. These are, these are authentic, real people. They have problems. They have failures like you and I do, perhaps even more so. And so when we read their story to go like, oh, God worked in their lives. This gives us great hope and confidence. He can work in my life, in your life as well. 

You know, the greatest story in the Bible is the resurrection. And when the gospel stories first write about it, in Mark it says the women came and told them. And you know, in the Roman and the Greek and the Jewish cultures, women were not allowed as witnesses in court. They were considered unreliable. If you want to prove your case, make it rock solid in that culture, whether you're talking to Greek speaking or Roman citizens or Jewish background people, believers, you don't say, well, we're building this on the testimony of women. It was like in that cultural context, it was like, Uhuh, this is not gonna be any good. 

And then this says, the disciples did not believe. And so that after they saw Jesus, they did not believe it was him. Like, if you're trying to be like, Hey, we are so amazing. We're like the great apostles, we saw Jesus. We knew it right from the start. He was gonna rise from the dead. No, they have Jesus face to face and they go, mm, I don't know. 

So when they actually are changed and understand through the Holy Spirit, all that God has done. Its like, this is not a put on. This is not fictional. And you don't make these things up. They the, if you are making it up, you do it all wrong. It's not a Hollywood movies where the superheros can jump out of airplanes without a parachute and land and not have a scratch on his face. It's just like, hello. These are not fabricated tales, pitching a false narrative. They are ruthlessly honest account that are, therefore, abundantly trustworthy. The Bible, God's word, is true to fact. It matches reality. We can be confident of it and pass it on the next generation and encourage them to keep doing the same thing, because it is trustworthy information. 

**Communication Sphere 11: Provides Transformative Information.**   
Isaiah 61:1-2. These are the first words that Jesus reads in the gospel of Luke when he is in the, in the synagogue of Nazareth, he says: The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted and to proclaim that captives will be released and prisoners will be freed. He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of the Lord's favor has come, and with it, the day of the Lord's anger against their enemies. 

God's Spirit led communication should always bring comfort, hope, freedom, healing, restoration, rejoicing. These are the things that are described in these words of Isaiah, which Jesus quoted that were the fruit of his ministry, of his communication. As we learned to communicate like he did, they should be the fruit, the transformative impact of our communication as well. See, the story of the gospel is simple. It's this that God is with us. God is for us. And he invites us into relationship with himself and that relational truth re- shapes our life completely if we will allow it. That's God's communication made true, made real, made practical in Jesus, and still alive, still bringing transformation to this very day. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
The next 11 passages all have to do with communication that we should seek to imitate. The Bible gives us so many examples of how to communicate well. So let's look at these together. 

**Communication Sphere 12: Inspired By The Spirit.**   
Matthew 22:43, Jesus responded, Then why does David, speaking under the inspiration of the Spirit, call Messiah My Lord… 

Jesus knows that David was not speaking just his own thoughts, but he was inspired by the Spirit. This is something we should all seek to do in our communication. We should seek to align our words with that of the thoughts and the words, the communication of the Spirit of God. And what this requires of us of course, is that we, before we speak, we need to listen. We need to listen to God. We need to reflect on his character. We need to reflect on his purposes. We need to meditate in his presence and understand what he's trying to say to us. And therefore what he’d like to communicate through us. And it's this place of intimacy of pursuit of God, of seeking to align ourselves with his Spirit that gives strength and power and anointing authority to our communication. So let's seek to the Spirit of God, allow him to inspire us to breathe his life and his words into us. As we seek to follow him. 

**Communication Sphere 13: Speak Like Jesus.**   
Matthew 7:28-29. When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority \- quite unlike their teachers in religious law. 

You know, if you go through this sermon on the mount, Matthew 5,6, and 7, there's hardly anything new or novel in Jesus’s teaching. If you look at the Rabbinic teaching those instructions, those records that are the Jewish faith outside of the Bible. Almost everything that Jesus said had been said by a rabbi previous to Jesus- turn the other cheek, love your enemy. Those were not \- Jesus was not the first one to say. That because there are logical, natural conclusions or implications of reflection and meditation on the scriptures of the Original Testament. 

So what he said wasn't so extraordinary. It's how he said it. It's not because he had a very nice voice and delivered it well. It was not about his methodology. It's that his life supported his words. His words were an echo of his life. He had lived what he was teaching. And so there was a resonance. There was an authenticity, there was a genuineness about his words that otherwise would not be heard in the words of someone who said the right things, but lived the wrong way. 

Jesus lived the right way and said the right things. And so when he spoke, people felt how genuine, real, authentic, powerful, and anointed his words were, because they're backed up by a life well- lived. If we want to be great communicators, we need to learn how to live life well. We need to live life obediently. We need to apply the truths of God to us first, and then when we speak to others, they, our words will carry that much more weight. 

**Communication Sphere 14: Align Your Communication With God’s.**   
Revelation 22:17 says this the Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” Let anyone who hears this say, “Come,”… 

This is a wonderful passage. It's almost a very last verse, getting close to the end of the Bible. And here we see the people of God, their words match the words of God. They, the Spirit says come. The brides says come. Everyone who listens should say come. This is absolutely marvelous. This is what we should do. And it's only possible as we listen and imitate what we hear. Well, that's, I want to do something new and novel and different you. Yes, but you don't wanna do anything new and novel that's different from God. A child listens to the father and mothers is learning to speak it. Everything that the father and mother say, the child repeats as closely has the child can. And that's how you learn to communicate well. It’s through the imitation of the parent, the one who gives you life. And God is the one who gives life to us all. So we must listen to him. 

The Latin word from which we get the word ‘confess' in English literally means to say the same thing as. When we confess, we are agreeing with or saying the same thing as another person. Usually we think of confessing as associated with our sin, that when we have done something wrong, we acknowledge that we've done something wrong. When we confess. What we're actually doing is we're saying when God brings conviction, we're acknowledging our guilt. And we are lining our perspective with God's perspective. 

You know, oftentimes if I might be having a, a devotional time with the Lord and God reminds me of a conversation I had the other day, and he says, David didn't know that conversation with this friend. Yes. He said, you lied. And I think back and oh, no, God, I didn't lie. I wasn't totally accurate, God. No, David, you lied. Well, I, I, I twisted the truth maybe a little bit. I exaggerated God, no, David, you, you lied. And see, as long as my words don't match his words, confession hasn't happened. But when I say, yes God, you're right. I acknowledge that I have lied. And my words matches and I've confessed. And that usually then leads to repentance and change of life in that example.

But we can confess other things when God says David you're loved and I'm feeling kind of down and discouraged. I go, oh nah, I'm just, I'm no good. David, you're loved and you're precious. And whatever God is saying to you, to me, we need to align our communication with his because he speaks truth. We often do not. And the more we align our communication, we confess, we listen carefully to what he's saying to us and make our words like his. Then we learn to communicate in a way that gives life to us and others who will hear us. 

**Communication Sphere 15: Speak the Truth in Love.**   
Ephesians 4:15. Instead we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. 

This is a wonderful passage. It's very easy to read and it sure is challenging to live out. Literally  this passage doesn't have the word speak, the communication is understood. But in the Greek if we translated it literally it would be,  we will, we will truth in love or truthing in love that we need to communicate in such a way. That truth and love are wed together in an inseparable way. 

You know, truth without love is not genuine, true, authentic truth. And love without truth is not genuine, true, authentic love. Truth and love need one another. Truth and love both exists in the person of God. They're both attributes of God. God is a truth teller. God is a lover and he doesn't sacrifice one to do the other. And if you think sometimes, well I just, you get irritated with a person and you're upset you say, I just need to tell him the truth, to tell it like it is. And you, you just abandon any thought of love or kindness or graciousness. And you just do that … Boy, that tends to mess up the relationship, doesn’t it? I know that probably we can all remember times where we've said things that we shouldn’t have said. But it's we need to keep these two blended together. They are inseparable in God and they need to become inseparable in us. Indivisible. Totally linked, totally hooked together. See truth is not true if it's not spoken in the Spirit of truth. And the Spirit of truth is always kind and loving and gracious. Even when correction is needed. Even when exhortation is required. It's always, always done in a loving way. When it's done, according to the Spirit of the truth. 

**Communication Sphere 16: Speak Seasoned with Grace.**   
Colossians 4:6. Let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have a right response for everyone. 

Seasoned. So when you take your food, the main staple and you sprinkle salt or coriander or cumin, or peppers or chilis or, oregano, something on it- and you take what is ordinary food and you spice it up. It becomes beautiful. It becomes memorable. It becomes wonderful. It seasoned just a little bit, but it makes all the difference to the flavors of the food and the experience of your meal time. And that's what grace does in our communication. You don't have to pile it on, but it is just enough to flavor everything that you say, everything you communicate. You see grace is what gives hope to the hopeless. It gives a way out to people who are feeling trapped, it brings confidence to those who are distraught. It clarifies the confused and encourages the discouraged. It forgives those who have failed and extends friendship to those who feel unlovable and who are feeling unloved. Grace changes all of that. And if we communicate well, if we communicate as God intends us to communicate, our words, seasoned with grace, bring transforming life-giving change to our hearers. 

**Communication Sphere 17: Speak in Order to Build Up.**   
1 Corinthians 14:26. Well, my brothers and sisters, lets summarize. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you. 

Everything that is done must strengthen all of you. 

Good communication fosters growth and development, pointing people in the right direction, championing and affirming their potential, helping them find their way forward. Good communication does not tear people down. It is not snide, it is never a cynical. It does not leave the listener stuck in their current life. It helps them see \-there’s a solution. There’s a hope, there's a way out. It helps them grow. It helps them develop. It's always serving them. This is what you need to think of \- is my communication serving somebody else? Paul says everything that is done must strengthen all of you. Are you strengthening people? Are you helping them? Are you assisting them? Are you empowering them? That's what good communication does. 

**Communication Sphere 18: Speak in Order to Encourage.**   
Acts 9:27. Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told him how Saul had seen the Lord on the way to Damascus and how the Lord had spoken to Saul. He also told him that Saul had preached boldly in the name of Jesus in Damascus. 

We were first introduced to Barnabas in Acts 4:36. And we find out that his name isn't actually Barnabas. It’s Joseph. Barnabas is his nickname, that literally means ‘son of encouragement’. Because Barnabas lived as a door opener. He put his own life on the line and he took the risk to communicate on behalf of others who were not trusted or respected by the majority of his peers. The first time we see this happen is with Peter's case. You can imagine the startup of the church numbers are growing. He's a fisherman. He's never handled this logistics of a operation this size. He’s a new leader in unfamiliar circumstances and there are lots of needs, lots of needs and lots of reasons why he should be discouraged and, and pushed to the side. 

And Barnabas has like all the credentials that Peter doesn't have. Peter doesn't have a religious background. Barnabas is Levite, he’s been trained. He's comes from a very wealthy family. He's he is got the social and the economic and religious credentials. And he doesn't say, Peter, move over \- I can do this job better than you. He goes and sells his own property and puts all the money to support Peter. This action is one of the best communication exercises in the Bible. Actions often speak louder than words and because he, he came and supported the leadership instead of challenging them saying, Hey, you guys don't understand how to do this. Stand aside, I'll take over. He cast his lot in with them. He supported them. That was huge. 

What if Barnabas had not done that at that moment? But Peter had just come out of jail and had just, it was a lot of questioning of what was going on in Jerusalem. He was probably very insecure at that point. And Barnabas helped him become the leader that he came to be. 

We see later that Barnabas goes and finds Saul, when everyone had been afraid of Saul because he'd been a persecutor of the church and, and he brings him to Damascus and uh, and he, he brings him to the leaders of the church in Jerusalem. And he speaks to them about how this man is trustworthy. You can imagine they would've been afraid \- Do we trust this guy? Is he just feigning conversion so he can get into our inner circle and then take us all captive and kill us like he has killed others in the previous life? And Barnabas risks his reputation and puts his life on the line to champion Paul, like he had done with Peter. 

And now just think about this. These are become the two most prominent leaders of the New Testament church, Peter and Paul, and both of them in a moment when the church might have considered, “I don't know about them.” Barnabas comes in and does actions that really encouraged them in very concrete ways, not just nice words, but costly things \- put his life on the line. If he had been wrong about Paul he would've ended up in prison or in at tomb himself. So he was there at decisive moments in the leadership development. 

So then think about this. Peter is either directly or indirectly responsible for three books in the New Testament. The two letters that he writes plus Mark, which is really Mark's account of Peter's testimony. It is the gospel of Peter, as retold by Mark, is how it's often understood. 

And Paul is responsible for 15 books directly indirectly. So the 13 letters he writes plus Luke and Acts, which his disciple, Luke, authors. And he wouldn't been in that position to write those, if it had not been for his association with Paul. So between Peter’s three and Peter and Mark's three and Paul and Luke's 15 \- that is 18 of 27 books, two-thirds of the New Testament are written by these two individuals and their immediate disciples who might not have thrived into their role, grown into their role of leadership, had Barnabas not come and been a champion, a door opener and encourager at a key moment in their lives. There's so much power in encouragement, so much power in coming alongside someone else and, and saying, I believe in you, God's hand is on you. You can do this. I am with you and willing to give up your land, perhaps give up your life in order to back up your words with real profound actions. Good communication really encourages and shapes history. 

**Communication Sphere 19: Speak with Self Control.**   
I'm gonna read from James 3:2-12. This is a longer passage, but boy, do we need to read it \- Do I need to read this again, and again and again. Let's listen to the word of God. Indeed, we all make many mistakes. For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and we could also control ourselves in every other way. 

We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth. And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong. In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. 

But a tiny spark is set a great forest on fire. And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself. 

People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brother and sisters, this is not right\! Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can't draw fresh water from the salty spring. 

Like I said, it's good to meditate on this passage. Read it again and again, with great regularity. Because if you can control your tongue, it is the ultimate good. All of us, I'm sure you can- I know I can- remember numerous times when we said something that just after we said it, we wish we could have taken those words and put them back in our mouth and just eaten them, just bitten our tongue just a second longer, because relationships have been broken. Pain has been compounded and all kinds of complications have arisen, because of things that you've said, because of things I've said. Tongue control is of paramount importance. This area of all the areas of self control, what he’s saying it's not that the tongue is more, the physical part of the body is more evil than other parts of the body, but it's just so easy to let evil be expressed with our tongue. 

Just saying an unkind word, a word that denigrates or demeans or yeah, just the cynical or robs someone of hope or of courage. All of us can do this. 

So tongue control is of paramount importance, not just in our personal relationships, but in the public media. Let's consider how is our media? Is everything that being said, stuff that's on the internet, online, in the news media, in print, on radio \- Is it giving life? We should not print, broadcast, tweet, post, everything that comes to mind. Just like you should not say everything to your friend that comes to mind. Exercise self control, tongue control, communication control. Run your communication through a grid. We have just looked at a variety of things we need to imitate. We looked at it is our communication truthful? Is it loving? Is it graceful? Does it build up? Does it encourage? If the communication doesn't do these things, don't do it. Don't tweet it. Don’t post it. Don't go through with it. Bite your tongue. Sometimes I feel like I got teeth marks on my tongue from just holding things back. But if it doesn't be pass the test of loving, truthful, gracious, building up encouraging, keep it to yourself. 

Authenticity is not a license for lack of self control. Discernment is a true mark of maturity. And knowing when to just be quiet is a mark of trusting God who can do things greater than your wrong communication will ever do. 

**Communication Sphere 20: Listen to Godly Advice.**   
Proverbs 25:11 says this: Timely advice is lovely, like golden apples in a silver basket. 

Listen, communication is a two-way street. It’s not just about what you say, but how you listen. It always begins by listening. It goes beyond hearing. You can hear something and not really be paying attention to it. You know, listening means you hear and you are focused. You're thoughtful, you're intentional, you're purposeful. And it doesn't go in one ear and out the other, it stays in there. That's listening. The Hebrew is **Shema** and the word for **Shama** both to listen and to obey. It’s really the old English word to “heed” \- to pay attention in order to apply. And so we need to listen to godly advice. That's where communication always begins. 

You know, I often think God has a sense of humor. Just look at someone else's face. Look at mine. I've two ears and only one mouth. I think it's like kind of like a hint \-Listen twice, speak once. And it's we need to give a lot more attention to listening. Well today we have so much power at our fingertips. We can communicate with the whole world. We can press a few buttons and millions of people can listen to us or watch us. And yet, if we have not listened well, our, our words could be destructive. James 1:19 says you must all be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to get angry. Quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to get angry. 

**Communication Sphere 21: Communicate in the Fear of the Lord.**   
Ecclesiastes 12:9-13. Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them. The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.

The words of the wise are like cattle prods —painful, but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep.

But, my child, let me give you some further advice: Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out… 

We'd love to quote that when we're studying at school and we're having to face the exact final exams. No much study wears you out. Mom, do I have to do all my assignments? Yes, I did do. So we go back to the scriptures. 

That's the whole story. And here and now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone's duty. 

So much insight here. You can take these passages and just unpack every phrase. So much truth. And when he talked about the books, the writing of books that is endless and much study wears you out, there's a lot of communication that doesn't actually strengthen you. It exhausts you. But God's communication is what builds you up. And our communication should always be marked by the fear of God. The fear of God does not mean that you are scared of him , it means the reverence of God, where you so treasure who he is and the things that he values \- that to do things that are contrary to his will, that would bring grief to his heart seems totally unacceptable to you. 

In Proverbs 8:13, it describes the fear of the Lord. It defines it as the hatred of evil. It's not because evil is wrong and it hurts us. It is wrong and it does hurt us, but ultimately evil grieves God, because he designed us for good. He designed us to do good, to be blessed by good, to receive good from others, and anything that is not good \- that destroys life \-is evil. And, and if you fear the Lord, we hate those things. So our communication needs to be shaped by the fear of the Lord. And then, then we'll communicate as we should. 

**Communication Sphere 22: Be True to Your Words.**   
This passage is from Genesis 31:44-54. I'm going to skip some of the passages, but it's an encounter between Jacob and his father-in-law and Laban were there're because both of of them had been cheated one another in the past, there was a breakdown of trust in their relationship. And so they have this encounter where they're trying to set things right for the future. 

So they begin saying, So come, let's make a covenant, you and I, and it'll be a witness to our commitment. So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument. Then he told his family members gather some stones. So they gathered stones and piled them in a heap. Then Jacob and Laban sat down beside the pile of stones to eat a covenant meal… Then Laban declared, this pile of stone will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today. This explains why it was called Galeed \-the witness pile. But it was also called Mizpah (which means watchtower) for Laban said, may the Lord keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other's sight. If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is witness to this covenant between us. 

God will see it. Even if no one else does. That's really important. 

See this pile of stones Laban confirmed and see this monument I have set between us. They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass those pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me. I call on the God of our ancestors, the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor to serve as the judge between us. 

So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac, to respect the boundary line. Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. 

So this is a serious moment in their relationship. They're trying to repair their brokenness and they, the resort to a custom that will seem foreign to most of us because it's not part of our culture, but they made these covenants that involve the sacrificing animals, making vows of meals together, setting up physical monuments, like a pile of stones and all of these activities. But it's just a various different way to say, you can trust me on this. This I will not violate this. I've maybe violated things in the past, but I'm going to keep the word here. See they had to go to great lengths because trust had been broken. And trust is the currency that allows relationships to happen. Without trust there's no possibility of loving relationships. It is foundational to any lasting relationship. And trust is built and people know that you will keep your word. 

Sometimes when there's brokenness, people go have to go to great length, to try to repair that brokenness, to try to restore trust. Jesus in the sermon on the mount in Matthew 5:37 makes it very simple. He says, let your yes be yes, and your no be no. If you always keep your word, if you just, you, you're not like, well, I just said yes, but I didn't really promise or I didn't make a vow. And then you go like, well, when can I trust your word? So just let your every word be consequential. Live up to whatever you you say, whether you make it official, do a big event or ceremony like Laban and Jacob did, or just in the normal course of life, let your yes be yes. May your every piece of communication be reliable.  

Psalm 15 is a beautiful  it's only five verses long. And it starts off with a couple questions Who may worship in your sanctuary Lord? Who may enter your presence on holy hill? And then in the next four verses it lists 11 different characteristics of those who can be in God's presence. I’ll read through them and listen carefully because of these 11, five have to do with your tongue, with your communication. Almost half of them. Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right. Speaking the truth from sincere heart. That's the first one. Those who refuse to gossip, that's the second one. Or harm their neighbor or, third, speak evil of their friends. Those who despise flagrant sinners and honor the faithful followers of the Lord \- and fourth, keep their promises even when it hurts. Those who lend money without charging interest and five who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent such people will stand firm. forever. 

So let's rehearse those things. Speaking the truth from sincere hearts, who refuse to gossip, who refused to speak evil of their friends, who keep their promises even when it hurts and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent. Eleven qualities, five of them related to the tongue. 

And I think in my own life, this fourth one, keep the promises even when it hurts, is perhaps one of the most consequential. Sometimes you make your commitment, I'll see you tomorrow, I'll do this, I'll do that. And then circumstances change. And then it’s no longer convenient to do what you plan to do. 

Will you follow up with your word, even when it's harder and it takes longer and it's more costly than you'd planned it to be? Even when keeping your promise hurts? Maybe you got an invitation to speak at a, a location and, and you said yes. And then shortly after **you get property,** speak at another location, that's bigger and grander and more prestigious. Do you forget the small one to take the big one? You keep your word. Do you keep your words to your family members, to your friends, to your boss? Do you keep your word? Is your communication reliable? Is it trustworthy? Is your yes, yes? Or can you only be trusted when you go to great lengths and have a big **covenant beyond, create** monuments like Jacob and Laban had to do? May we all be people who live in such a way that we may enter to God's holy hill because we've spoken as we ought to speak. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
We have just finished looking at several passages that talk about communication that we should imitate. Now we're gonna look at eight passages of communication to avoid. The Bible is so practical. It gives us such concrete instructions as how to communicate well and how to avoid oral communication. 

**Communication Sphere 23: Do Not Distort God's Character.**   
This comes from Numbers 15:30, But those who brazenly violate the Lord's will, whether native born Israelites or foreigners have blasphemed, the Lord, and they must be cut off from the community. 

This passage is very interesting, because it helps us understand what blasphemy is about. Blasphemy is so much more than just using God's name as a curse word. The word of the Hebrew word for blasphemy is **xxxxxxx.** And it means to spurn, to hold in contempt, to despise, and abhor. It is disrespect towards God, which leads one to brazenly violate, as it said here in this passage in Numbers, his will. To go against his will without any consideration of who he is. Blasphemy creates a culture of willful disobedience. When you feel free to disrespect God, you feel free to disobey him. Ezekiel  39:10 has a similar passage. It says blasphemy is defined as betraying God or acting treacherously against God or being unfaithful to God. To blaspheme is to reduce something grand and glorious to something mediocre and insignificant. When we do that, disastrous consequences occur for our society. 

I'd like to read for you a passage from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. This is a beloved book by CS Lewis that is a parable of the Christ and uh, how he redeems humanity. And in this story, the Christ figure is a lion, a glorious, powerful majestic lion named Aslan. And at this point in the story, he's going to relinquish his life to redeem the sins of one who had been disloyal. And so he's giving himself a freely of his own volition, uh, just like Jesus did when he went to the cross. 

So as he comes to be killed on the stone table in that book, the witch who is the enemy says, 

**let him first be shaved. Another war of me laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with an pair of shes came forward and squatted down by ASO's head. Snip, snip, snip went the shearers and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground. Then the ogre stood back in the children, watching from their hiding place could see the face of Aslan, looking all small and different without its mean. The enemies also saw the diff difference. Who are these only a great cat after all Craig one is that what we were afraid of said another. And they surged around as UR, same thing like earth or. And how many mice have you caught today? Cat. And would you like a sauce? Milk puss.** 

**Oh, how can they send Lucy? This is one of as its followers who was hiding at a distance tears, streaming downward cheeks, the roots, the boots for now that the first shot was over the short face of as looked to her braver and more beautiful and more patient than ever muzzle him said the witch. And even now as they were working about his face, put in on the puzzle, one bike from his jaw would've cuts cost two or three of them, their hands, but he never moved. And this seemed to ENR all that Rav. Everyone was at him. Now, those who had been afraid to come near him, even after he was bound, began to find their courage for a few minutes, the two girls could not even see him. So thickly was dis surrounded by the whole co of creatures, kicking him, hitting him, spitting him and ging at him**. 

That picture is such a vivid description of what it means to blaspheme. It's to ridicule, to demean, to a place where you feel like you can do anything, uh, to reduce a great lion to a house cat, to reduce the God of the universe to someone that you could despise and disobey. We should never allow any communication that would diminish the grander of our God. 

**Communication Sphere 24: Do Not Distort Your Neighbor's Character.**   
Deuteronomy 5:20 says You must not testify falsely against your neighbor 

Lies destroy a person's reputation. They do damage to the relationships they have with others. When you lie against your neighbor, you diminish him or her in the eyes of their acquaintances. You create distrust and disrespect and rupture of relationship. Slander destroys the fabric of society. See, we were made by a loving God for love. We were made for relationships. We're given the qualities that are necessary, made in his image so that we can respond to love with love. We were made for relationships. Relationships thrive when truth is spoken. They suffer when falsehood becomes normative. If our private communication and our public media are filled with lies, if slander is normative, then relationships are damaged and society crumbles. 

**Communication Sphere 25: Do Not Listen to Ungodly Advice.**   
Psalm 1:1-2. Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night.

In the key passage number 20, which you might have looked at already, which is about Proverbs 25:11 we are urged to listen to godly advice. Here we are warned against listening to ungodly advice, snarky scoffing, and mean hearted mockery is communication we should avoid. Avoid practicing it and avoid those who do practice it. Don't say it. Don't listen to it. Stay far away from it as you can.

**Communication Sphere 26: Do Not Participate in Gossip.**   
Proverbs 17:4. Wrongdoers eagerly listen to gossip; liars pay close attention to slander. 

If you have a problem with someone, if there's a something that needs to get sorted out in your relationship, go and talk directly to that person. Or if they're not available, talk to someone who can talk to that person who can make things right. Use your communication to repair the damage that has been done, to solve the problem, to restore relationship. Any other kind of communication, any talking behind the back, commenting to third parties who have no possibility of helping solve a problem only creates more relational trauma. It destroys relational harmon when you gossip. Gossip is saying anything about someone that you would not comfortably say face to face with them. Don't say it. And don't listen to it. Shut it down. If someone else starts talking to you evil about someone else, and they're not in the room, walk away. Distance yourself from communication which speaks ill of another when they are not present. 

**Communication Sphere 27: Do Not Participate in Arguments.**   
2 Timothy 2:23-25 says this: Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights. A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth. 

And similarly, Titus 3:2 says that God's people should avoid quarreling. And 1 Timothy 3:3 says that godly leaders must be gentle and not quarrelsome. The spirit of quarreling **foments** division. In contrast Proverbs 15:1 says a gentle answer, deflects anger, but harsh words make tempers flare. 

Both private and public communication should be done in such a way as to not throw fuel on the fires of arguments. Our words should facilitate harmony or they, they will incite division, anger, violence. What are you seeing on the media? What are you seeing in your own conversations? Are we doing communication in accordance to God's word? 

**Communication Sphere 28: Do Not Participate in Complaining.**   
Jude 1:16. These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want. 

Grumbling and complaining should not be a part of our lives or our communication. Ungratefulness always breeds relational discord. Gratefulness nurtures relational, harmony. Faith, hope and love, the three great virtues of 1 Corinthians 13 cannot grow in the soil of ungratefulness. When grumbling and complaining abound, those virtues die out. Grumblers are focused on themselves and what they don't have. They're the glass not only half empty but all empty; no matter what you give to them is never enough. It's a miserly way to live. Grumbling is the language of the selfishly entitled. A grumbler can never be satisfied no matter how generous you seek to be with him or her 

**Communication Sphere 29: Do Not Participate in Slander or Mockery.**   
Nehemiah 4:1-4. Sanballat was very angry when he learned that we were rebuilding the wall. He flew into rage and mocked the Jews, saying in front of his friends and the Samarian army officers, “What does this bunch of poor, feeble Jews think they're doing? Do they think they can build a wall in a single day by just offering a few sacrifices? Do they actually think they can make something of stones from a rubbish heap — and charred ones at that? 

Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, remarked, “That stone wall will collapse if even a fox walked along the top of it\!” 

Then I prayed, “Hear us, our God, for we are being mocked. May their scoffing fall back on their own heads, and may they themselves become captives in a foreign land\! 

Mockery seeks to diminish another in the eyes of society. It is demeaning, belittling, and casting aside, ignoring any good in their accomplishments. “That wall? A fox will tear it down.”  This manner of communication and the heart that breeds it is never very useful in building a healthy society. These are things we should avoid. 

**Communication Sphere 30: Do Not Participate in Prideful Boasting.**   
Psalm 75:4-5. I warned the proud, Stop your boasting\! I told the wicked, Don't raise your fists\! Don't raise your fist in defiance at the heavens or speak with such arrogance. 

The proud person elevates himself or herself over their neighbors. This is the other side of mockery and slander. Mockery and slander puts other people down. Pride elevates yourself. It is inherently rebellious. You're not satisfied with this status quo. You're unhappy. You're trying to make the situation different by force of will and imposing yourself upon other people, dissatisfied with the status quo until you get to the top spot. We need to have a change of heart and a change of communication. Humility speaks graciously. Pride speaks boastfully. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
When we understand that we were created for relationships and that communication is the foundation for relationships, without communication, there is no relationship. Then it is important that we have a good communication vertically with God and horizontally with neighbor. In this next section, we're gonna look at six passages that talk about how we should pursue vertical communication with God. And this is gonna be a two-way street. That's letting him speak to us and us speaking to him and him responding to us and us responding to him. This is absolutely amazing. If we have to get this in our personal lives, we also have to get it in our public life. We need to understand that in the public sphere of communication, God wants to guide us. God wants to speak. God wants to lead. And he wants to give us the wisdom that we need. So let's really press in to see what God wants to teach us in these next six passages. 

**Communication Sphere 31: God Speaks…We should listen.**   
Hebrews 2:1-4. So we must listen very carefully to the truth we have heard, or we may drift away from it. For the message God delivered through angels has always stood firm, and every violation of the law and every act of disobedience was punished. So what makes us think we can escape if we ignore this great salvation that was first announced by the Lord Jesus himself and then delivered to us by those who hear him speak? And God confirmed the message by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit whenever he chose. 

The wonderful thing about this passage is the clear affirmation that God is not silent. He's a communicating God. He reaches out to us. We don't have to go chasing him. Sometimes we say, oh, we found God\! Like God never got lost. We got lost and he found us. He comes after us and he pursues us and he communicates with us and he communicates even before we're willing to listen. He's saying things and that if we pause and listen, it would make such a difference. This is such a great joy. Hallelujah\! Let's become skillful listeners.

You say, well, I've not heard God. Well, think of a radio. Maybe you've had a radio and then you haven't and it's just sitting there and you're not hearing anything, you need to ask yourself. Maybe I need to turn on? So you turn the volume and you still don't hear anything. You go, oh, maybe I don't have the batteries in. So you put the batteries in and you turn it on again and still not hearing. Well, maybe the dial is not at the right place. And so you have to start moving things. You, we have to dial in. But just because you can't hear the sound coming from the radio doesn't mean that there are not radio waves. Just because you’ve not been hearing God does not mean that he's not been trying to reach out to you and communicate. This passage says he's been doing this for generations in many, in various ways because he loves you. He cares for you. So let's listen to God speaking. Let's listen carefully. Let's listen very carefully, as we're exhorted to here. 

**Communication Sphere 32: God Speaks… We should speak.**   
We're gonna read from John 1:1-9. In the beginning, the word already existed. The Word was with God. And the Word was God. He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him. The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone. The light shines in darkness, in the darkness can never extinguish it. 

God sent a him, John the Baptist, was to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony. John himself was not the light; he was simply a witness to tell about the light. The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. 

What a wonderful passage. Right from the very beginning, God is such a communicator. He created the world through his speech, that we could speak of the pre-incarnate Christ as the Word, the very essence of reaching out relationally to touch us. And when he became a human being and came into our world, he continues to speak and his speech, his communication causes darkness to flee away. This is wonderful stuff, but it's not just enough for God to be speaking. He invites us to join him in that communication. And he, John the Baptist first understood this and he began communicating: This is the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And when we can listen to God and hear what he's saying, and then align our speech to match his, then that's very powerful. We must be bearing witness of what God is doing in our midst. When we do that, we're communicating as we should. 

**Communication Sphere 33: God Reveals…We Can Know.**   
Amos 3:7. Indeed, the Sovereign Lord never does anything until he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets. 

You know, many times those who are holders of information, withhold that from others because there's power in that information. There's they can use information to control or to manipulate,  because they're holding it to themselves. But the beautiful thing about God is that he shares all the information that he has with us. That is helpful for us. He's not withholding anything needful for us because God is not power hungry. He's servant hearted. And he reveals \-that means he clarifies, he brings understanding. God's word is not confusing. It's it's not a difficult. If we take time to read it in its context and we listen carefully, we can know. 

There’s several wonderful things about this passage. First of all, is this wonderful disposition of God to share his vast knowledge with us in a way that serves us and is beneficial and helps us.  God is power sharing. He is, he's been generous through his abundant proclamation, through his abundant revelation. As finite beings, we can't possibly know everything that an infinite God knows, but in his goodness, he gives us everything that we need to know. And 2 Peter 1:3 says that he has given us everything we need for living a godly life. There's nothing. There's nothing. Of what God has communicated that is lacking, to lead a godly life. If you wanna lead a different kind of life, um, maybe you'll find some lack, but who wants to do that? See, as finite beings, we can have confidence that even though we don't know everything, what we know we can know truly. We’re sure. His revelation is truth, is constant and is knowable. It's generously given, is not held back, and is sufficient for us to live a life confidently \- knowing what is good and what is right. Our communication in private and in public should do the same. 

**Communication Sphere 34: God Listens… We can speak.**   
Luke 18:35-43. As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting beside the road. When he heard the noise of a crowd going past, he asked what was happening. They told him that Jesus the Nazarene was going by. So he began shouting “Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me\!” Be quiet\! The people in front, yelled at him.

But he only shouted louder, Son David, have mercy on me\! 

When Jesus heard him, he stopped and ordered that the man we brought him. As the man came near, Jesus asked him, what you want me to do for you? 

Lord, he said, I want to see\! Jesus said, All right, receive your sight\! Your faith has healed you. Instantly, the man could see, and he followed Jesus praising God. And all who saw it praised God, too. 

So many beautiful aspects of this story. Our God displays this incredible humility that he pays attention to us. He hears us. He listens. You can imagine Jesus walking down that, that road. So many hundreds or thousands of people milling around, this huge multitude, a lot of noise, lots of chatter, but he's, he's listening. He's listening for the one who's crying out in need. And he hears this blind beggar. His voice stands out in his, in Jesus’s ears, it's over the din of the crowd. And he, everyone else is saying, shut up. Don't talk\! like you’re not important to God. And Jesus. He is important to Jesus and Jesus stops. So this passage just up to that point is already amazing, it displays God's willingness to listen to us. To us. Of course we should listen to him, He's the great one, but that he would listen to us. That's remarkable. 

But then once he has the blind beggar in front of him, he doesn't say, oh, you're blind. You need to be healed. He doesn't presume upon the blind man's desires. He asks a question, what do you want? Why are you calling out to me? You can say, well, he's God, He would know. It's obvious. People probably murmuring about it \-he needs to be healed. But he doesn't jump the gun. He doesn't finish our sentences for us. He listens, he’s attentive. He focuses on us. We can speak confidently to him knowing that he pays attention to each and every one of us in our needs. And when we are- tell him what we need, he's there to provide it for us. Miracles happen. Miracles happen when God listens and he invites us to speak. 

**Communication Sphere 35: God Responds… We Can Trust.**   
Judges 6:36-40. Then Gideon said to God, If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised, prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know you're going to help me rescue Israel as you promised. And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up earlier the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and run out a whole bowl full of water. 

Then Gideon said to God, Please, don't be angry with me, but let me ask one more request. Let me use the fleece for one more test. This time let the fleece remain totally dry while the ground around it is wet with dew. So that night God did is Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew. 

You know, the amazing thing about this story is like, God doesn’t say, Hey, I already told you just believe me, come on. He doesn't rebuke him for wanting to verify and confirm and check and double check- Is this really what God's saying to me? I mean, when God calls you to do something, when you're trying to discover your identity, your purpose, your vocation in life, whether it's in the sphere of media communication or any other sphere in Gideon’s case, it was to be in a military governmental role. Whatever that call is, it's like amazing. There's a purpose. Is this really God? Does God really have a plan for me? And he does. And sometimes it seems like me? really? And God's willing to take the effort to communicate again and again. Okay. You said it, now prove it to me. Okay, I'll do it. This, you want this? Okay. I do that. Now do the opposite. Okay, I'll do that. 

And he just wants you to know with great confidence that he sees you, he's attentive, and he's designed you for purpose. And when we understand the role of communication, we need to be able to speak with that same attentiveness, communicate with that same heart, to infuse confidence and destiny and hope and direction. God made sure that Gideon was certain of his guidance. The specificity of his response gave him great confidence that God saw in detail and would lead him in every moment. God will do the same for you. And we need to communicate that same kind of thoughtfulness to others. 

**Communication Sphere 36: God Guides… We Can Follow.**   
Exodus 13:21-22. The Lord went ahead of them. He guided them during the day with a pillar of cloud, and he provided light at night with a pillar of fire. This allowed them to travel by day or by night. And the Lord did not remove the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire from his place in front of the people. 

His guidance was present every moment of every hour of every day, while they were on the journey that he let them on. His guidance was clear both day and night and never left them. And was always appropriate. In the daytime that pillar of cloud probably provided the shade for those who are close enough to it. And it helped them cool off in the hot desert temperatures. But at night it gave them light and a sense of wellbeing because they were out in this unknown place. In utter darkness. God's communications is guidance is appropriate for each circumstance in which we find ourselves. He guides so well. It enables us to follow him easily. If we'll just listen, look, and pay attention, he will lead. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
We just finished a section about pursuing vertical communication with God. Now we're gonna look at 10 passages about pursuing horizontal communication with our neighbors. This is part of living the life that God designed us to live. He made us for relationships and communication is the foundation for relationships, whether vertically with God or horizontally with our neighbors. 

**Communication Sphere 37: One on One.**   
Roman 12:14 Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them. 

And this passage, we are encouraged to respond in the opposite spirit. This is what Jesus did when he went to the cross. To those who wanted to kill him, he said, Father, forgive them. He prayed blessings and mercy on their heads. See if we do to others what they do to us, then they are leading the relationship. They punch us in the nose and we punch them back, we’re just imitating them, following them. If they punch us in the nose, instead of reacting, which is doing the same action again, re-act, we respond. And that response is in the Spirit of Christ. And then that, that process becomes very transformative. It's costly. It cost Jesus his life. It might cost you, but it changes the whole relational dynamic. So pray that God will bless them. 

St. Francis prayed, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where there's hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there’s despair, hope. Where there's darkness, light. Where there’s sadness, joy. This is how we are to respond in the opposite spirit, the Christlike spirit, in order to bring redemption to even those who are are enemies. 

**Communication Sphere 38: One To Many.**  
We're gonna be reading from Isaiah 52:7. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the messengers who bring good news, the good news of peace and salvation, the news that the God of Israel reigns\! We're called to be proclaimers of good news to all, not just to a few. We're to sometimes look at every form of media, every form of public communication that's in our press or on internet or news channels. And we need to use every means possible to proclaim good news. That's what it means to be beautiful feet on mountaintops. The mountaintop, it goes everywhere, can be seen or heard or understood from a long distance.   
You know, in our media and the world, there's so much bad news. There's so much distressing, discouraging, upsetting news. Wars and inflations and conflict and riots and starvation and sickness and pandemics. And people need good news. So let's not be afraid. Let's stand up and say we have good news to share, good news that changes not only the course of an individual's life, but news that will change the course of our society, of our culture, of our history. Good news is needed, desired, wanted by all. And God enjoins us. It's our responsibility to share his good news with all.  
**Communication Sphere 39: Many to the Many.**   
Psalm 68:11 the Lord gives the word and a great army brings the good news. We're gonna be reading from Isaiah 52:7. How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the messengers who bring good news, the good news of peace and salvation, the news that the God of Israel reigns\! We're called to be proclaimers of good news to all, not just to a few. We're to sometimes look at every form of media, every form of public communication that's in our press or on internet or news channels. And we need to use every means possible to proclaim good news. That's what it means to be beautiful feet on mountaintops. The mountaintop, it goes everywhere, can be seen or heard or understood from a long distance. 

You know, in our media and the world, there's so much bad news. There's so much distressing, discouraging, upsetting news. Wars and inflations and conflict and riots and starvation and sickness and pandemics. And people need good news. So let's not be afraid. Let's stand up and say we have good news to share, good news that changes not only the course of an individual's life, but news that will change the course of our society, of our culture, of our history. Good news is needed, desired, wanted by all. And God enjoins us. It's our responsibility to share his good news with all.  
Many are involved in proclaiming good news. This is not just a role of pastors or evangelists. This is not just a role of the religious sphere. This is a role in every sphere, but perhaps most importantly, media and communication. We need to be able to speak of the good things that are happening on the earth. People need hope. Yes, we need to be real. We need to address the issues as they are, but when you only give the bad news, you're not being real. You are, you only talk about everything that's going amiss in the world. That's not the full picture. And you have to tell the stories of the victories of the kingdom of God and how God’s Kingdom is growing and moving across the face of the earth. And that is so important. We need that hope. We need that strength. We need that confidence. 

**Communication Sphere 40: A Voice for the Voiceless.**   
Proverbs 31:8-9. Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those being crushed. Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless, and see that they get justice.

 While we're speaking Good News. We also need to make sure that we are advocating for those who have been oppressed. Those who are suffering, those who are in need. We need to address issues of injustice and aid them in making their needs known, so that change can happen. Consider, who do you know, what situations are you aware of where people cannot defend themselves? They cannot advocate for themselves? Advocacy is always more powerful when you do it for a third party. If you try to advance your own cause, it never is quite rings true; when you advance somebody else's cause, seeking their wellbeing, then that is true charity. That is true goodness. That wins the hearts of people and that brings deep, lasting transformation. 

**Communication Sphere 41: High Tech or High Touch.**   
2 John 1:12. I have much more to say to you, but I don't want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete. 

Wow\! Paper and ink. That doesn't sound very high tech. Well it was in his day. It was the latest communication technology available to Paul. And he used it to its fullest extent. As did John and Peter and, and the others who wrote in the New Testament. We live in a time of incredible innovations in communication technology exploding, and we have more power in our phones, in our tablets, in our computers than any generation has ever had on earth before. You can speak to the whole world, But even though we have all this power in our hands, is our communication better? Technology alone does not communicate the message. It is the mode of communicating it, but some things you really need to do face to face. Some things warrant an in person touch. Sometimes technology is insufficient to say all that we want to say. You know, you can chat on zoom, but it's not the same. Try and give a hug or share a cup of coffee with a flat screen. It just doesn't work. 

Communication is essentially about relationships. And sometimes we just need to put our technology down. Sometimes I see a room full of people, all sitting side by side, each staring at their phones and have working their thumbs, talking to someone who's not there. Ignoring the people who are to their right, to the left or across the table. This shouldn't be. We should encounter one another in personal face to face dialogue and enjoy the benefits of the technology that we have in these days. But don't forget. It's about being face to face, looking a person in the eye and letting them know that they are valuable, that you love them. And you find joy when you're in their presence. 

**Communication Sphere 42: In Times of Crisis and Danger.**   
Ezekiel 3:16-21 After seven days the Lord gave me a message. He said, Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately. If I warn the wicked saying, you are under the penalty of death, but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. If you warn them and they refuse to be repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you'll have saved yourselves because you have obeyed me.

If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself too 

Clear communication is essential in times of crisis. And God raises up his people in the sphere of media and other spheres to proclaim truth in times of need, in times of crisis. We need to have this perspective of a watchman. The watchman sits on a high tower at a vantage point on the wall of the city. So they have a large panoramic view of all the area around the city, can easily see anyone approaching any danger, anything that might threaten the city. We need to have that broad perspective of the world, station yourself to have the biggest picture possible. We live in a day when social media and, and all of the algorithms get us narrower and narrower, narrower. You like something five times and that's all that ever appears on your devices. Break out of the narrowness of the molds that our digital world tries to force us into and have a broad perspective. 

And in the midst of that, be attentive to the voice of God. When he says in this situation speak thus, in that situation, speak this other thing, then that is really important- to hear and obey, says here immediately. Public communication can be a matter of life or death. Embrace the role of communicating responsibly. The common good depends on how clearly and quickly we communicate. It needs to be accurate. It needs to be timely when we're in crisis. Your role as a communicator is so vital. Have a big picture. Listen to God, obey. Communicate 

**Communication Sphere 43: In times of joy and good news.**   
This comes from Acts 19:17-20. The story of what happened spread quickly all through Ephesus, to Jews and Greeks alike. A solemn fear descended on the city, and the name of the Lord, Jesus was greatly honored. Many who became believers, confessed their sinful practices. A number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire. The value that books was several million dollars. So the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect. 

Paul was in Ephesus on his missionary journey. And just a few verses earlier, it says that he had done extraordinary miracles, not just miracles, but extraordinary. What it meant is that people were giving to him handkerchiefs and he was touching them. And the handkerchiefs would be passed on to other people. And whoever touched the handkerchief got healed. There are several other stories that lead up to this passage. This was a time of just the goodness of God being displayed as healing and miracles were going on. Communication was so important in the midst of that situation, the story of what God was doing and needed to spread throughout the province of Asia (which today would be Western Turkey for us) so that people would know what God was doing. We need to be good communicators. Not only when there are hard, difficult times, but in times when there's joy and good news.

**Communication Sphere 44: Communicating In Ways Appropriate for Your Hearers.**   
1 Corinthians 9:19-23. Even though I am a free man with no master, Paul writes, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ. When I was with the Jews, I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ. When I was with those who follow the Jewish law, I too, lived under that law, even though I'm not subject to the law, I did this so I could bring to, to Christ those who are under the law. When I am with the Gentiles who do not follow the Jewish law, I too, live apart from that law so I can bring them to Christ, but I do not ignore the law of God. I obey the law of Christ. When I'm with those who weak, I share their weakness for I want to bring their, the weak to Christ. Yes. I try to find common ground with everyone doing everything I can to save some. I do everything to spread the good news and share in its blessings. 

This is such a wisdom in this passage, he tries to find common ground with everyone. He knows you have to know your audience, if you're gonna be a good communicator. You have to identify with them. And though the message is the same, the way it's presented might vary depending on the crowd or the public that you addressing at that given moment. You tailor your communication to meet their needs. 

Paul had one gospel message, but the way he communicated to the people with Jewish background or to Gentile background was appropriately modified for their situations. There was no one, right way. Be attentive of how you can be creative in taking the unchanging message and find the appropriate ways to communicate that in a given context. Always bear in mind the purpose of your communication. Don't get so involved in the communication that you forget the “why”. The why is so that they might be able to spread the good news or share its blessing. Stay focused on the goal. Paul was singular in his goal, but varied in his methodology. 

When we have a message to share the message is singular, but the methods by which that message can be communicated might be varied. And so Paul understands this and as a great communicator, he modifies the ‘how’ of the message while being true to the “what” and the “why” of the message. This is what all great communicators do. You're attentive to the context, creative in the methodology, and true to the goal. 

**Communication Sphere 45: Know When To Be Silent.**   
Ecclesiastes 3:7. There's a time to be quiet and a time to speak. 

There are times when saying nothing is the best policy. Do not be driven by “I have to communicate”. Is it really necessary? Is it always beneficial? You know, do you really have to answer every tweet and every email within three minutes? Do you have to stop life? Is it that urgent? 

Job’s friends show true friendship when they first came to see him in his distress and they sat with him in silence. We read in Job 2:11-13, the following: when three of his friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognize him. Wailing loudly. They tore their robs and threw dust into the air, over their heads to show their grief. Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that he was suffering and was too great for words. 

Sometimes there are situations where the, the suffering is too great for words. And as long as they were quiet, they were good friends. When they started speaking, everything started going south. It was no longer beneficial. Their identification with the sorrow was the best communication. Their silence had been the best communication. 

A number of years back, we were living in another continent. We had some dear friends who, the husband suffered, a major medical problem and had to be rushed in the hospital under intense surgery. Over the next week or two, my wife and I stayed with the wife, visited the hospital, helped with the children and did everything we could to help their family. During that time, many people sent cards and made phone calls. And at first they were like, we're so sorry. We're praying for you. But as time went on, they started saying, why do you think he got sick like this? Did he disobey God? Are you disobeying God? Are you, you know, have you let down your shield? And they would come and, and try to figure out why he got sick.

Friends, we don't always know why we get sick or why certain things happen to us. That's the story of Job. And then one day, my dear friend, the wife of, my friend who was in the hospital had just received a call and someone had, was blaming her for her husband's illness. And, trying to be helpful, I think, that person was in their own mind. But she came off the phone and she was crying and she was saying, came to and said, David, I just want to thank you all these people, trying to give them wisdom, trying to explain why my husband is sick, but you, you are been such a good friend. You are a friend with no wisdom.” 

Because I've not tried to solve the problem. I was just there. My wife was just there and we were present. We weren't trying to explain things and teach things or sort things out. That's not always what we're supposed to do. Being present, being silent, being caring that's enough. So don't always talk. Listen, be still. 

**Communication Sphere 46: The Right Time and Place to Speak.**   
Esther 2:10 Esther had not told anyone of her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had directed for her not to do so. 

This is such an important lesson from this book. Because Esther listened to Mordecai and exercised self control over her communication, she didn't say everything she could have said about herself. She kept her ethnic identity a secret. It was unknown. And her appropriate silence enabled for this climatic moment to occur when there was the reveal of who she was in the presence of the king and the presence of the one who was trying to wipe out all of her people. And the silence at one point, and the speaking at the right time at the right place, turned the table on the dreaded enemy and resulted in her people being saved from a certain destruction. 

Listen to God, not only about what to say or how to say it, but when to say it, and he will guide you. Proverbs 15:23 says everyone enjoys a fitting reply. It is wonderful to say the right thing at the right time. 

**CROSSOVER PASSAGES**  
We are now ready to look at the crossover passages, how the sphere of media communication connects with the other spheres. And some of the examples will be examples of positive interaction between those two spheres. And some will show ways in which they did not work well together. We can learn from all of these situations. 

**Communication Sphere 47: Media/Communication and Family**  
The crossover between Media/Communication and Family. Genesis 49:28. These are the 12 tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said as he told his sons goodbye. He blessed each one with an appropriate message. 

That is a word that concludes the previous 27 verses in chapter 49 of Genesis, which Jacob, knowing that he's about to die called all of his sons into the room and goes one by one and blesses each one. He affirms each one with a unique message, their identity, speaks with their destiny and, and gives them a word that will guide them into the future. This is so important. There should be “a blessing spoken here” as the motto of every household. You know, sometimes you go into stores \- it says German spoken here, French spoken here. “Blessing spoken here” should be the family motto. Home is where our communication should shape the identity and destiny of the next generation, giving us confidence to face the future and their challenges of life. Parents are crucial in establishing a culture of communication that bless the next generation 

**Communication Sphere 48: Media/Communication and Economics.**   
Matthew 28:15. And this is gonna be an example where it did not go good. So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and they still tell it to today. 

See, the context is this. We read the previous verses, in verses 12 to 14 that a meeting with the elders was called and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe. They told the soldiers, you must say, Jesus' disciples came during the night while we were sleeping and they stole his body. If the governor hears about it, we'll stand up for you so you won't get in trouble like serious trouble.

Like serious trouble. The Roman guards, this select group was came from elite, military division. They were in groups of four. The military Roman rule was that if any one of the four was caught having fallen asleep during the night, all four would be killed. 

So when they say, we'll make sure you don't get into trouble- Like this is big trouble. They're they're gonna be dead. So if they say we fell asleep, their, their lie would make, put their life in peril. So they say, we're gonna pay you lots of money and we'll intervene so that you won't be executed. They knew they had not fallen asleep. Roman soldiers didn't do this. The body had not been stolen. To confess to do this would've made them guilty of the death penalty. But the religious and political military leaders conspired together to use finances, used the economic sphere, to perpetrate a lie. Not all communication is true. In this situation bribery distorted the truth. Economics was used to fabricate a wrong impression that was communicated publicly for not only at that time, but still many years later, this was the report that people believed.

**Communication Sphere 49: Media/Communication and the sphere of Government.**   
Proverbs 15:22 plans go wrong for lack of advice; many advisors bring success. 

Jesus applied this principle when he gave the following example and Luke 14:31-32, he says this, Or what king would go toward as another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him. And if he can't, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away. 

Good communication from good advisors is essential for good decision making in government and really in any other sphere as well. Communication plays a very key role. 

**Communication Sphere 50: Media/Communication and the sphere of Religion.**   
We're reading from Ecclesiastes 5:1-7. As you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God. Don't make rash promises and don't be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few. Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool. When you make your promise to God, don't delay in following through, for God makes takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him. It is better to say nothing than to make a promise or not keep it. 

Don't let your mouth make you sin. And don't defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was mistake. That would make God angry, and he might wipe out everything you have achieved. Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead. 

Wow, this is a good passage. Speaking about religious vows. We’re exhorted to exercise self control over our tongues. Keep your ears open and your mouth shut is the advice that is given. Sometimes less communication is the wisest communication.

**Communication Sphere 51: Media/Communication and the Sphere of Education.**   
Proverbs 2:1-2. My child, listen to what I say, and treasure my commands. Tune your ears to wisdom and concentrate on understanding. 

This attitude, the attitude of an attentive listener is central to the heart of education. The student should approach the experience of education with a heart dedicated to silence and submission. That's a strange phrase for us in our modern times. But this phrase, silence and submission, it was a common language in the ancient middle east, and implied to willingness to heed and obey instruction. It communicated that you are adopting a posture of being teachable. It's very hard to learn if you're not teachable. Your teacher can speak all they want, but if you're not participating with that right attitude has, that's just an essential part of communication that we listen well. 

Here’s some, some thoughts from a thesis that I wrote before. In Paul's time the Rabbis agreed that silence was an admirable attribute for the highest scholar. The command to learn in silence was not a derogatory comment, such as we regrettably might address to children, shut up and listen to what the teacher says. No, on the contrary as Simon, the son of Gabrielle, explained: all my days, I grew up among the sages and I found nothing better for a person than silence. 

This perspective of education was true, not only among the Jewish rabbis, but also among the Greek gentile philosophers**. Plutarch** said, but those who instantly interrupt with contradictions, neither hearing, nor being heard, but talking while others talk, behave in an unseemingly manner. Whereas the man who has the habit of listening with restraint and respect takes in and masters a useful discourse and more readily **sees** through, and detects a useless of false one, showing himself thus to be a lover of truth and not a lover of argumentation and contention. 

We need to listen well as students. And it's not just when you're in grade school and high school or in college. Throughout life, we need to maintain that attitude of a disciple. Listen, listen carefully to others. Anyone can teach you. Anyone, in any moment might have a truth that you need to hear. So if we adopt this attitude, communication and education work together to lead us into more truth. 

**Communication Sphere 52: Media/Communication and Celebration.**   
Esther 8:17. in every province and city, wherever the king’s decree arrived, the Jews rejoiced and had a great celebration and declared a public festival of holiday. And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves, for they feared what the Jews might do to them. 

Our communication and celebration are wedded together and a continuum from the pragmatic, all the way to the aesthetic. All communication involves art and all art communicates. The function of the message and the beauty of the form are closely intertwined. It's all most impossible to speak of one, without speaking of the other. These two spheres are always working hand in hand. And if, when they both are doing it well, it result is glorious. 


**Celebration Key Passages**  
Transcript from David Hamilton’s Video project for the SourceView Reader  
June 2023

**Celebration Sphere Introduction**  
The sphere of Celebration involves Arts, entertainment, and sports. God's purpose for the sphere of Celebration is to strengthen hope and build community. Ever since the days of Jubal as recorded in Genesis 4:21, artists have used their skills to entertain people and speak to the heart issues of their culture. Biblically, these artistic gifts are often linked with the prophetic ministry. When God's ideas are embedded in story form, the truth resonates with both heart and mind, maximizing their impact. Stories of God's work in the past, produce courage and strength for the present and hope for the future. 

The first section that we're going to be looking at, as in all the spheres, is God and how he relates to the sphere, in this case the sphere of celebration. There are going to be six key passages. And the first three are based on **Romans 14:17**, which says for the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. We'll see how God brings righteousness, peace and joy and uses celebration. And it's not just our human endevours, but we do this in the Holy Spirit with his participation. The second three in this category will consider the nature of God's creation. This sphere celebrates creativity. We're to live as his masterpieces, the fruit of his craftsmanship exhibiting both inner and outer beauty. 

**Celebration Sphere 1: God's Kingdom Promotes Righteousness**   
Psalm 145:7 says everyone will share the story of your wonderful goodness. They will sing with joy about your righteousness. 

There is power in story. There's power in song. Propositional truths, just abstract statements about reality, about who God is, who humans are, what the universe is like, tend to engage only the mind, but truths that are embedded in story, truths that are connected with life and, and can be told in an artistic way, touch both mind and heart. And so they make a deeper and more lasting impression. Biblical righteousness is not about religious performance. It's about living in right relationships, loving relationships, vertically with God and horizontally with neighbor. It's about being kind and forgiving. It's about acting like God acts. Imitating God's character and nature, how he relates to people. And this like Colossians 3:12-15 describes biblical righteousness. You must cloth yourselves with tender hearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Make allowance for each other's faults and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember the Lord forgave you. So you must forgive others. Above all, clothe yourself with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony and let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body, you are called to live at peace and always be thankful. 

When we use the sphere of Celebration to advance these qualities of righteousness and how we relate to one another, then the sphere is being used in the right way. 

**Celebration Sphere 2: God's Kingdom Promotes Peace.**   
Reading from Colossians 3: 15 and let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts for as members of one body, you are called to live in peace. Always be thankful. 

In the world the thinking is ‘conflict sells’. So our news media is filled with stories of bad news. Focusing on the works of our common enemy. Wars, riots, disasters, economic hardship, acts of injustice. Are these tales of wrongdoing being used to cultivate division? Or promote unity in our society? Are we looking at the evil in the world and considering how do we get even? Or how do we move towards reconciliation and peace? 

When we think about Celebration and how we portray the stories and the events of our lives, we need to be people who encourage us in a movement towards peace, towards unity, towards harmony. This is not by being superficial or covering up, covering up difficulties. God does not hide problems. He's a realist, but not to live like ostriches with our heads' stuck in the sand, pretending if we don't see it and we don't hear it and we don't speak it, then it's not there. We don't live unaware of injustice or unaware of the things that work against peace. But we need to act in such a way and use the power of this sphere to advance the cause of peace and unity, relational harmony. That's what this sphere is all about. 

**Celebration Sphere 3: God's Kingdom Promotes Joy.**   
Zephaniah 3: 16-17. I love this passage and we often don't quote anything from the book of Zephaniah. So listen well. On that day, the announcement to Jerusalem will be cheer up. Zion. Don't be afraid for the Lord your God is living among you. He is a mighty savior. He will take delight in you with gladness, with his love He will calm all your fears. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs. 

He will rejoice over you with joyful songs. You know, when a young man falls in love with a young lady, you can tell almost immediately. He starts walking two feet off the ground, has a lilt to his step and a song in his heart. He stops talking in prose and begins writing poetry. Everything changes in how he communicates, in how he faces life. You can't help but break into poetry. You know, actually in the Bible, the first time poetry is used is when Adam lays his eyes on Eve for the first time. He erupts into this magnificent form of artistic literary communication. 

You know, to live well people need love and joy as much as they need food and water. And what this passage tells us that when God is in our midst, He too sings. For the subject of that song is you and me. He sings over us. He sings to us, He sings about us. Have you taken time to pause and listen to God singing to you? 

You see, joy is not a circumstantial feeling that comes and goes with changing realities. True joy is that deep delight which comes from the confidence that it we have when we look into someone's eyes and know that that someone treasures us and loves us. When we look to God, that's what we see in His eyes. When we listen to God, that's what we hear in His songs. And that's what gives us joy. 

In God's presence we're told in Psalms 16: 11, there is fullness of joy. There is absolute joy in all his most complete expression. Why? Because He loves us fully and is always communicating His love to us, if we'll take time to listen, if we're willing to hear. Biblical celebrations are designed to help us reflect on God's joy-giving love for each one of us. 

**Celebration Sphere 4: Beauty and Function.**   
Psalm 19:1 says the heavens proclaim the glory of God, the skies display His craftsmanship. God's creativity is limitless. It's extraordinary. It's magnificent. It's breathtaking. It's both functionally excellent and aesthetically exquisite. 

When He creates with a word, He calls the galaxies to spring into existence. And though they function within the laws of physics, which to some might sound very dry and mechanistic, they also display extraordinary beauty. When we do things in this sphere, they should be things that are both pragmatic and aesthetic. They function, it works. It's real. And, and it's also beautiful and delightful, winsome and attractive. 

**Celebration Sphere 5: Masterfully Created to Be Master Creators.**   
Ephesians 2: 10 says for, we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus. So we can do good things He planned for us long ago. 

The word in Greek is we are God's poeme where we get the English word poem. We can write in many different ways, but poetry is more elegant. It's more artistic than just prose. It requires additional thought. You think about rhyme and meter and, and symbolism. And you do a lot of things through indirect allusions. It's a masterful way to write. Many people can write prose well. Only a few can write poetry well. God says that we are his poems. We are his masterpiece artistic expression, And he's made us to participate with him in being creators. He's made us to do good things in every sphere, including the sphere of Celebration. Not all celebration that is done in the world is good. We’re to do… We're called to do good celebration. What are the good things that enable arts, entertainment and sports to make a beneficial contribution to our society? We know that these very powerful tools have been used to destroy lives of individuals and families of corrupt society, but they when used correctly, they're good things that I can participate in in this sphere that can advance God's masterpiece plan. 

**Celebration Sphere 6: Beauty Within and Without.**   
We read from Isaiah 53:2 the following, my servant grew up in the Lord's presence like a tender a green shoot, like a root in dry ground. There was nothing beautiful and majestic about his appearance. Nothing to attract us to him 

In this passage, it's a prophecy of the coming Messiah, of Jesus. And what it is telling us is that God steps into our world in such a way that there wasn't a big splash, a big there wasn't a red carpet and a trumpet sounding and saying, look, what a magnificent thing is happening. 

He was born in a very ordinary way. He lived as a, in a very ordinary way. He was common to us. Incarnation is absolutely extraordinary. The glorious majestic wondrous king of the universe stepped into our ordinary world and just was with us. He was like us, Hebrews says, in every way, except that he did not sin. And he brings life-giving beauty into the ordinary things of life. 30 years he lived in our midst. It was kind of unsuspecting. No one would've thought. And the neighbors grew up with and said, ah, look at this guy. He's the son of God. He's God incarnate. He was just one of us. There was nothing majestic about his appearance. He was just like all the others. 

But when he began his ministry in our midst, wow, the difference it made. 2 Corinthians 4:7 says something similar about what happens with God's spirit inhabits our hearts. He said that we are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure. God was in Christ. God and man blended together in just a remarkable indescribable way. This treasure and in a clay jar. And that true beauty that is within him, changes us. We're attracted to Jesus, not because of, of externals, but because of his heart, his love, his sacrifice, his identification with us. Jesus makes all the difference. It's not a beauty of externals, but a transforming eternal beauty that calls us all to Himself. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
In this next section, we're gonna be looking at 14 passages that focus on the purpose of celebration. Celebration is very purposeful and very powerful. It is the least authoritative and the most, perhaps the most influential of all the spheres. If we understand why God gave us this sphere, we can use it in a way that really enhances God's purposes on earth. So let's consider these things together. 

**Celebration Sphere 7: Celebration Affirms that We are Destined for Joy.**   
Hebrews 12: 1- 2 says this. Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially this sin, that so easily trips us up and let us run with endurance the race that God has set before us. We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith because of the joy awaiting him. He endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honor beside God's throne. 

This phrase that that is so interesting is “because of the joy awaiting him”. Jesus was able to embrace a lot of very difficult, painful things. The cross was costly. But he had a destiny in which he was aware of joy. And of course, as we looked at it earlier passage, he's thinking about the restored relationship with the Father. Psalms 16: 11 says that in God's presence, there was fullness of joy and he was expecting to be returned to the Father with all of that relational richness. And that motivated him. This needs to be what motivates us in the sphere of Celebration. We see this theme throughout the Bible. In chapter 15 of Luke, there are several parables that are only found in that portion of the Bible. There's a lost coin, the lost sheep and the lost son. We often call the prodigal son and each of these stories, the idea is that something or someone gets lost and then they get found and get recovered and they are. And when that happens, there's a concluding statement. This is a symbol of what happens when a sinner repents and is restored to relationship with God. And in verse seven and verse 10 in chapter 15 of Luke, it says that when the, this happens there's joy before the angels of heaven when a sinner repents. There is joy before the angels of heaven, that's an interesting phrase. Think about it. If you are an angel in heaven, what would you be looking at? Now, you wouldn't be looking at streets of gold or this or that or the other. You've been there all your time, and those are just like common, ordinary things. If I was an angel in heaven, I'd be looking at the one who is the centerpiece attraction. You're looking to the person of God all the time. So when it says when they rejoice, because they're, they saw joy before the angels is that they're seeing God face erupt in joy when a sinner repents. It's not a casual, oh, yes. One more for the kingdom. Lets notch it up. It's not a task that God is dutifully fulfilling. He delights. When a person comes to faith in Jesus, he throws a party. He calls his friends. He celebrates. It's real. He really celebrates and its God's joy and anticipation of living joyfully with him, in that presence that should guide all of our activities, including how we do celebration. 

**Celebration Sphere 8: Celebration Creates a Safe and Welcoming Space.**   
We're gonna read selections from Genesis 18:1-8, 16\. One day Abraham was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the hottest part of the day. He looked up and noticed three men standing by. When he saw them, he ran to meet them and welcomed them bowing low to the ground. My Lord, he said, if it pleases, you stop here for a while. Rest in the shade of this tree, while water is brought to wash your feet. And since you've honored your server with this visit, let me prepare some food to refresh you before you continue on your journey. When the food was ready, Abraham took some yogurt and milk and the roasted meat, and he served it to the men. As they ate, Abraham waited on them and the shade of the trees, then the men got up from their meal and they left. Abraham went with them to send them on their way. 

You know, in our Christian tradition, we celebrate Abraham as the man of great faith. And he believed in God and so was counted to him as righteousness. So he is known as the father of faith. And that is appropriate. That that is as we, as we should do. But within the Jewish tradition, the characteristic that is most celebrated about Abraham is his hospitality. Because he was hospitable. And we read on this story. We see these three men was actually some representation, Biblically it is called a theophany of God and a couple of angels. And he actually had an encounter with God. And he offered his hospitality to God. Because he welcomed God, he became God's friend. And that is the foundation. 

So whether it's faith or hospitality, each tradition is celebrating attributes that are really important for a relationship with God. 

Hospitality is telling a stranger who's in a place that's unknown \- it might be a place that creates fear and insecurity- come be with me. When you're with me, you'll be safe. You are welcome. And I want you to be safe. This was a very, very high value in the cultures of the ancient middle east. The value of hospitality was supreme. If you welcome somebody into your home, as long as they were in your home, you defended them. You protected them. Even if their enemies came, you stood up for them, even though you were just getting to know him. So this protocol around hospitality is very, very strong in the roots and the foundations of biblical thought and in the Hebrew people. And so we see that this provision of food, the caring, the culinary arts expressed in all of these activities were related to making a place that is that safe and welcoming. And we should make sure that when we do theater or movies or symphony or art in any form, that we do it in such a way that those who come and gather to our place, that they feel safe, they feel welcome. They know that while they're being entertained, no harm will come to them. They are protected. 

**Celebration Sphere 9: Celebration Creates a Sacred and Restorative space.**   
We're going to read from Exodus 25: 8-9. Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary. God says, so I can live among them. You must build this tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according into the pattern I will show you. 

God's instructions to Moses, give an extensive and detailed description of what the tabernacle was supposed to look like. And the execution of its creation was followed with absolute obedience to every single detail. It involved beautiful craftsmanship that went into the furnishing of the tents and all the accessories that filled the tabernacle. They used finest materials, the best threads, the best leather, the finest gold, the precious stones, everything was just absolutely top of the line materials and the most skillful artistry. 

But the most exquisite aspect of the tabernacle was not the furnishings or the tent. It was God's Emmanuel presence. That was the wonder. That this gorgeous setting with all of the artistry that was involved in it, housed the presence of God. He lived among them. Artistry done according to God's pattern, what he shows us, creates a platform of God's redemptive presence to be in our midst. Thus the artist has a great responsibility and a great privilege and opportunity, a unique opportunity to create a space that God can inhabit and reveal himself to his people. 

**Celebration Sphere 10: Celebration Releases Gifts of Anointed Craftsmen.**   
Exodus 35: 30 all the way through 36: 1 here's some selections. Then Moses told the people of Israel, "The Lord has specifically chosen Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. The Lord has filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and expertise in all kinds of crafts. He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze. He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood. He is a master at every craft. And the Lord has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their skills to others. The Lord has given them special skills as engravers, designers, embroiders in blue, purple, and scarlet thread on fine linen cloth, and weavers. They excel as craftsmen and as designers... The Lord has gifted Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other skilled craftsmen with wisdom and ability to perform any task involved in building the sanctuary. Let them construct and furnish the Tabernacle, just as the Lord has commanded. 

You know, Bezalel is the first person in the Bible described as being filled with the Spirit of God. This might surprise you. It's not Moses or Noah or some of the famous patriarchs, it's an artist who's talked about in this way. God anointed the countless years that he undoubtly spent in cultivating his craft and developing his skills. Multifaceted\! you can see he worked with cloth. He worked with leather, he worked with wood. He worked with fine metals, gold and silver and bronze. He was a craftsman, jeweler, designer, textile artist, goldsmith, leather worker. The list goes on and out on. He must have been a remarkable person to meet. Such ability. But it wasn't just his natural skills. He was filled with God's Spirit and he used his skills in conjunction with God's Spirit to obey God's purposes. When this happens, the excellence of artistic gifts are yielded in total obedience to God, His Spirit, great things can happen in us and through us that benefit many. 

**Celebration Sphere 11: Celebration Builds Community.**   
This is taken from Esther 9: 26-28. So because of Mordecai's letter and because of what they had experienced, the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year. These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants. 

You know, this is true. Thousands of years later, two and a half millennial later, Purim is still being celebrated by Jews all around the world. It's on calendars that you can look up, even for those who aren't Jews. Festivals that happen on a regular basis are community events that create a sense of common experience. They give us a common story, a shared history, and this shapes our identity, our culture, and our values. It's a point of societal connectedness. It gives us a sense of belonging to one another. When we do these events together, we strengthen our solidarity as a community. 

Celebration is really important. It binds us together. It makes us one. It gives history and a future. It gives identity for the present. Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sacks did a Ted talk in April 2017, which is one of the most viewed Ted talks of all time. He's talking about these very issues and he mentions this. He says, "Jews have been scattered and dispersed in exile for 2000 years. We never lost our identity. Why? Because at least once a year on the festival of Passover, we told our story and taught it to our children. And we ate the unleaven bread of affliction and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery. So we never lost our identity. \[?\]. 

Here are people for millennia without a homeland. And yet they maintained an identity. He was talking about the feast of Passover. We read about the feast of Purim, there were multiple other feasts that are described in the Bible. God gave instructions to these recently liberated slaves who came out of Egypt and said you're gonna start a new nation. And he spent a lot of time talking about how they're to party, how they're to gather and have a feast, what to eat and what to do and what to talk about. And it's quite incredible, but these are very important aspects. If we're going to be a people, we can only be a people when we learn how to celebrate together and tell our story to one another, remind ourselves what God has done and what we could become. 

**Celebration Sphere 12: Celebration Clarifies Identity and/or Destiny**   
Psalm 137:1-6. This is written during the time of the exile in Babylon. An unknown author says this: Beside the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept as we thought of Jerusalem. We put away our harps, hanging them on the branches of poplar trees. For our captors demanded a song from us. Our tormentors insisted on a joyful hymn: "Sing us one of those songs of Jerusalem\!" But how can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a pagan land? If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget how to play the harp. May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I fail to remember you, if I don't make Jerusalem my greatest joy. 

Here's an artist who is grieving. When we think of celebration, we're not just thinking of happy, clappy, go lucky. You know, festivities. The whole sphere of Celebration helps us experience the whole range of human emotion and builds a sense of community together. Songs create deep synaptic pathways in our mind, in our brain, that just help us forge a sense of identity. Singing together creates a sense of shared identity, shared destiny. We belong. 

So when you are in a rough place like they were, the enemies were urging them to sing that songs of happier days in a sense of mockery. But he remembered that he would sing songs of deepest love for Jerusalem, for who they were and where they'd come from and where one day they would be going again. And that's, that is what this sphere is supposed to be about. It's supposed to help us live and relive the story of God in arts, as a people over and over again, so that we can achieve his purposes and we can make it through the rough times because better times lie ahead. 

**Celebration Sphere 13: Blessings and Cultural Honor Protocols.**   
Matthew 26: 7-13. While he was eating, a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head. The disciples were indignant when they saw this. "What a waste\!" they said. "It could have been sold for a high price the money given to the poor." 

But Jesus, aware of this, replied, "Why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me? You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me. She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial. I tell you the truth, wherever the good news is preached throughout the world, the woman's deed will be remembered and discussed." 

You know, it's, It's worth spending money on celebration. Sometimes we can reduce ourselves to very functional, pragmatic living and just do what's absolutely necessary. If you do on only that which is necessary, life becomes very flat. It's becomes a blend of different shades of black and white and grays. A celebration adds the color. It's not essential, but it's sure enriches everything that we experience. This woman understood this. It was extravagant. It was over the top. It was in some ways unnecessary, but Jesus saw her heart and honored her. He knew that as an artist, she was doing what was so important. She was doing the right, appropriate, cultural honor. And he defended her. It wasn't a waste of time. It wasn't a waste of money. It wasn't a waste of effort. It was pleasing to God. Artists do things that \- you go like, oh, that doesn't put food on the table. No, but it brings joy to the heart insight to the spirit and courage to the soul. And those things are as important as enough calories to keep going through the day. So art is very important. 

Every culture uses arts in a way to pay tribute and honor those who are praiseworthy. Our cultural icons are celebrated it through protocols of celebration. And they, when we do that well, we enforce our cultural values. Now if our cultural values are biblical, that's a great thing. But when they align with God's character in his ways, great, good is achieved through these protocols. 

We elevate certain ones as heroes and role models and put them as a paradigm, say, this is what you should aspire to be like. That is helpful. That points the new generation, the emerging generation towards what real significance, what real importance or real value is all about. So we need to honor these cultural protocols. 

**Celebration Sphere 14: Celebration Creates Cultural Heroes and Role Models.**   
Genesis 10: 8 \- 9\. Kush was also the ancestor of Nimrod who was the first heroic warrior on earth. Since he was the greatest hunter in the world, his name became proverbial. People would say, this man is like Nimrod. The greatest hunter in the world. 

Highlighting individuals as heroes is a means of discipleship. When we do that in cultures, we're telling people, be like that\! That person exhibits something that is praiseworthy, something you should aspire to. This sets an aspirational goal before young men and women who are from that emerging generation and inspires them to pursue the accomplishments of those who've gone before, of those role models. It encourages them to exercise discipline and work hard and do the stuff necessary to excel. 

Sports heroes, like Nimrod, who, you know, excelled in the sport of hunting and cultural icons like musicians or actors and those in the entertainment industry, become a stimulus for disciplined skill development. If you want to be really good, if you want to win this trophy, if you want to get an Oscar, if you want to be recognized as top in this class, you're gonna have to work at it. And so having the right heroes and who exhibit the right character and values is so important in the society. And where you do celebration right, we help determine what those storylines are so that people are aiming for the right goals. 

**Celebration Sphere 15: Celebration Promotes True Love.**    
1 Corinthians 13:4-7 says this: love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable and it keeps no record of being wrong. It does not rejoice about injustice, but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up. Love, never loses faith. It is always hopeful and endures through every circumstance. 

Celebration when rightly done promotes true love. Distorted celebrations pervert love, and lead people down wrong pathways that will end up destroying their lives. Celebration is really important. It can give life or it can bring death. It can teach about true love or present a facade of a counterfeit love. Let's do it the right way. 

**Celebration Sphere 16: Celebration Strengthens Truth.**   
Isaiah 42:10 \-12, sing a new song to the Lord. Sing his praises from the ends of the earth. Sing all you who sail the seas, all you who live in distant coastlands, join in the chorus, you desert towns. Let the villages of Kedar rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; Shout praises. Shout praises from the mountaintops. Let the whole world glorify the Lord. Let it sing his praises. 

As you read through this passage, you see it has people on the seas, on the coastlands on islands, in the mainland in villages and cities on mountain tops and valleys. Everyone is invited to participate in this song. 

Truth is best grasped, best understood, best embraced in story form. When truth is conveyed through song, poetry, novels, theatrical performances, movies, literature, paintings, sculpture. It is richer than mear propositional abstract declarations of truth. 

Now, if I were to tell you that if you're going to defeat the enemy, you need to cultivate friendship. You need to endure through hardship. You need to be willing to make any sacrifice, to help someone else to serve someone else. You have to be faithful and true and constant and not give up hope when all circumstances seem to be despairing. Now, what I just said is true, but if you were to try to write this down without pausing and rewinding, it'd be difficult for you to do that. But if I told you, just watch the Lord of The Rings. That's a movie that exhibits those principles. Once you see the movie once or twice, you don't have to copy my list. You can reflect on the story and draw your own principles, your own insights. That's why story is so powerful. And when its put to song or some visual form or audio form, and it's even more so because it lands in our hearts and stays with us and it is absolutely transformative. So consider this, make the join in the song, tell the story, participate in celebration. Let the world know God has done a wonderful thing. 

**Celebration Sphere 17: Celebration Reinforces Hope.**   
Psalm 146: 5 it says, But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper, whose hope is in the Lord of their God. 

When we understand God's purposes for the arts, we understand that He \- that the Arts are to be used to reinforce hope in our lives. Movies inspire, songs strengthen resolve, stories point the way. True art helps us see beyond our day-to-day concerns and worries and look to the future beyond our present circumstances to what might be. And this gives us hope.   
This is so important for us. We always need to have a goal that is greater than ourselves that we're running towards. And the great stories, the compelling stories of all time point to that great picture in the future that aspiring happily ever after or walking into the sunset, that the kingdom of God coming in its fullness, whatever that metaphor, whatever the idiom.   
And that gives us hope to keep fighting the good fight, to keep persevering in the midst of adversity, to keep doing the things that we need to do every day to see that hope realized.   
If you see a movie like the Lord of the Rings, you realize it was very hard going. But because they had a dream that one day they would return to the shire, to their homeland, and the evil would be conquered and the beauty would be restored. They endured great sacrifice and difficulty. If we're gonna become culture changers, if we're gonna transform our society, it's gonna take a lot of constant day in, day out sacrifice. Hope inspired by the arts keeps us going.   
**Celebration Sphere 18: Celebration Helps Us Cope with Sorrow.**   
Ecclessiates 7:1-4. A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume and the day you die is better than the day you are born. Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties. After all everyone dies. So the living should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter for sadness has a refining influence on us. A wise person thinks a lot about death while a fool thinks only about having a good time. 

Uh, this is an insightful reflection on celebration. It's the day you die is better than the day you were born. You see when you're born, you don't know what life is gonna be like. You don't know if the person that beautiful little child is going end up his life in a praiseworthy model or horrific criminal. We all have great hopes and anticipation. But at the time of death, we can look back on our life that is well-lived. We can truly celebrate. And at funerals you think about what is life really about? How did they live their life? Was it well spent? How should I live my life? Am I doing the right thing? See celebration is not just about throwing a party. It's about coming together as a community in each and every circumstance of life from birth to death and reflecting on what is really valuable in life. Funerals are an important time of reflection. Considering the value of life, the purpose of life, the direction of my life, of your life. 

We create events around someone's passing from life to death. We don't just go on as normal. We pause. We have a vigil. We gather, we remember we talk. We tell stories. It's done in different ways in different societies, but it's a time that requires reflection, of gathering of family and friends and to consider what life is about. This is valuable exercise. We grieve when there's war and hundreds die, and there's no time to do that. And the bodies are just put into a mass grave to make sure that illness, disease is not spread among those who remain after the battle is over. Each life is significant and we are to think about the value of life and celebration, coming together in this way enables us to do that. Music and literary reflections are often used at the times of a person's Memorial service to bring comfort and perspective on life, strengthening the community of mourners and their resolve to live their lives well. 

**Celebration Sphere 19: Celebration \- A Catalyst for Good or Corrupted for Evil?**   
Numbers 21:8- 9. Then the Lord told him that's Moses, who was facing a difficult situation because this incredible plague of this illness had swept through the people. He said this, make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to a pole. All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it. So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake would look at this bronze snake and be healed. 

Now, this is a fascinating story. There was no healing properties in the bronze snake itself. Healing happened when people obeyed God in faith. God said if you'll look at it and you'll be made well, they did that in obedience to God and they were indeed healed. So this act of celebration, it took time from the time the Lord gave him this instruction. He would've given instruction, maybe Bezalel or Oholiab or one of the artists would've assist him in fashioning this bronze snake, making this image and then putting it up on this pole. It was a thing of blessing and redemption and healing in that generation. 

But time went on and if you read in 2 Kings 18:4, you see that many generations later, this bronze snake had been kept and was being used in inappropriate ways. It had actually become an object of idolatry. So different from the original purpose of being a source of blessing. Because they were looking at the artistry rather than the purpose of the artistry, the faith that it inspired and the focus on God and trust in God and returning to his ways. So we see that this story was used well in Moses's time and later generations, it was used incorrectly, but Jesus picks up this theme again when he's talking to Nicodemus. We all probably can say John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son. Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Do you know what the two verses that are just before that? Versus 14 and 15, because it begins with, “for God”, there's a connector. What happened just before is what gives the foundation for that very famous verse that we often cite. So John 3:14 and 15, Jesus is talking about the same snake. There was a blessing at one time and used in idolatry as another time. As Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the wilderness, so the son of man must be lifted up so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life. So it became once again a paradigm of virtue, of ultimate redemption, because Jesus would be lifted up on a pole. This was a metaphor for him dying on the cross. And if we looked to him with faith in our hearts, just like they looked at the snake with faith in their hearts in Moses' generation, we would be safe as they were healed. And so once again, God comes to restore this artistic expression, which was well used, then misused and then redeemed in its use to point us toward God's ways of redemption. 

**Celebration Sphere 20: Use and Abuse of the Arts.**   
2 Timothy 3:4 says that Time will come when people will love pleasure rather than God. 

Now the arts are pleasurable. When done well, they are delightful. They're attractive, they're inspiring. They are engaging. But there's a always a danger of worshiping the gift and forgetting about the giver. So we need to be careful that we do not become lovers of pleasure. 

We should not absolutize pleasure, which is called hedonism, making that the ultimate goal. It's destructive to the individual and to society. If pleasure is the goal, we are on a dangerous ground, but when pleasure is the fruit of our pursuit of a loving God and His good and kind and righteous purposes in our lives, then we are on solid ground. Let's keep pleasure as the fruit and keep God as the goal. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section is about the five senses in God's design. As we're gonna look at 11 different passages, the first one, one will be introductory giving an overview of the concept and the other ten paired in five sets of two, talking about each one of the five senses, taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight. You see God designed us for relationship, for relationship with himself. And with one another. He wanted us to live in a loving relational context. He wanted us to live in community, and when we understand God's purposes and see how he designed us, these senses are tools that enable us to have community. They’re designed to increase relationship. And so, it gives meaning for how God made us and why we have these particular faculties. And this only underscores the importance of celebration, which perhaps more than any other of the spheres really uses the five senses to the maximum to achieve the power of the storytelling, the dramatic narrative that's often communicated through this sphere of celebration. 

**Celebration Sphere 21: Affirmation of Creation and Community.**   
1John 1:1-4  says this, We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning, talking about Jesus, whom we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own. He is the word of life. This one whose life itself was revealed to us. And we have seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life. Just love it. Doesn't say he's the one who has eternal life. He is eternal life. He was with the father and then he was revealed to us. We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us and our fellowship, our community, our belonging to one another is with the father and with his son, Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that you may fully share in our joy. 

You know, this is, is a pivotal hinge passage that informs all of our thinking about the sphere of celebration. This is really the overarching conclusion of the purpose. This could have been the culminating passage for the last section on the purpose of celebration, but it's also the introduction to this section about how we engage with the five senses, how they contribute to God's design. That we as human beings live in right loving relationships in community with God and with one another. When reality is truly experienced, when we touch God, when we see God, when we hear God \- as the apostles did, as John writes, and it is then shared, it is done in such a way that others may enter into and participate and be a part of that same community and share in the joy. This is what this is all about. We pass on our experiences to others. We convey what God has done in our lives. So they too can participate in the community of God. The kingdom of God, the purposes of God are advanced on planet earth. 

**Celebration Sphere 22: Taste: An Enjoyable Gift.**   
Ecclessiates 2:24-26. So I decided there was nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God, for who can eat or enjoy anything. Apart from him. God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. 

We've all enjoyed a good meal. Taste is absolutely an incredible gift from God. We didn't have to have taste buds in our mouth. It wasn't necessary. We could have eaten with flavorless. And if we didn't know what flavor was, we wouldn't know what we were missing. What a delight that we have flavors. Why does God do this? This is the first of the five senses we're gonna be looking at. And it's the most intimate sense your taste happens inside of you. Now you can stick out your tongue and put a little bit of sugar on it, or a little bit of salt, but most of the time, our tongue is well inside of our mouth, as we're chewing our food, right? It's something very private. If I chew my food, I say, oh, this tastes so good. I don't take it out and offer it to you and say, would you like to have some of this? You go, “no, thank you. If you've already chewed it”. You chew another portion of that same food that's presented on the table and you're not chewing the exact same food that I am, but it's a liking kind and forms a bond. You go, oh yeah, this is so good. This is the best, whatever, that I've ever had. It's intimate. It’s internal. It happens inside of us. And yet it creates a profound sense of belonging. 

You know, as I travel the world and visit our missionary friends in different places, I often ask, well, what do you like about this place? And they'll talk to you about things and what do you miss about home? And they'll talk about things. Invariably, one of the first things someone says about what they miss of all is they'll mention a certain kind of food and I'm aware of that. So I often travel with food in my suitcase, food from the homelands of the people that I'm gonna be visiting to give them a little bit of that flavor, or when the people from other nations in my home, I prepare food from their Homeland to make them feel welcome. These are important things to be doing. It's something special. 

You know, there are special flavors that you associate with the good memories of your childhood. Things that your mom made things that your grandma made, things that are neighbor or your favorite aunt made things that were just, uh, you go like, oh, that was so good. And that delightful memory is impregnated into your mind in association with that food. It gives you a sense of belonging. And we talk about food as being Korean or Mexican or Thai or Chinese. And what are those? That's the experience of a culture, of a people. And this gives a sense of identity. 

We all eat food. We all use spices, but the way they're combined gives us uniqueness. And so taste shapes our unique cultural communities; that gives us a sense of belonging. And that is really important. We need to cultivate the culinary arts. 

**Celebration Sphere 23: Taste: (Culinary Excellence Shows Honor)**  
Once again, we look at taste a second time. Culinary excellence shows honor. 1 Samuel 9:22-24. Then Samuel brought Saul in his servant into the hall and place them at the head of the table, honoring them above the 30 special guests, Samuel in instructed the cook to bring, Saul the finest cut of meat. The piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor. So the cook brought in the meat and placed it before Saul. Go ahead and eat it. Samuel said it, I was saving it for you even before I invited these others. So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 

Wow. In every culture, there's a special food that you bring out when there are special guests. This is what was happening when Saul was first met with Samuel. And as shortly after he was anointed to be king. And these statements of favorite foods or best foods or honoring foods, are cultural ways of celebrating people who are to be respected. They build, help us build relationships. Now, some places in the world where I've traveled, I hope I would not be so honored because if you’re really, really honored, you get to, to eat the lamb head or the fish eyes or the palm of the gorilla. So I would prefer to not be quite so honored from my cultural perspective. But you know, as I've traveled, I've learned to eat things that I might not relish in my own culture, but it's really important to say thank you and eat with joy with a smile. Even though it's a have to work at that smile, because people are trying to give you their best. 

Food, taste, honor, relationship. They're all connected. Think about this. We build relationships around food.  Leonard Sweet has written a great book From Tablet to Table. The by-line is Where community is found, an identity is formed. The idea of this is that we might have concepts of principles and truths that are on the tablet. You know, the commands of God, but they really only take place in our lives when they start becoming real around a table, as we eat and celebrate with family and friends. That’s where life really happens. Would you consider using taste and your gift of your own culinary arts to advance the kingdom of God? Have a special meal at your home. Invite your neighbors, share a meal, invite someone who's homeless. Someone who you don't know so well. Show hospitality. Allow taste to be a bridge to declare “I care for you” and display the relational realities of the kingdom of God. 

**Celebration Sphere 24, Touch. (Strengthens Relationship)**   
This is the second of the five senses the move. We'll be looking at two passages on touch. This one is how touch Strengthens Relationship. It comes from 1 Samuel 18:4, Jonathan sealed a pact that he made by with David by taking off his robe and giving it to David together with his tunic sword, bow and belt. 

I wonder what that looked like. There's not a lot of details in scripture, but I'm sure he just didn't throw these down at David feet and Say, take them. They're yours. He probably handed it to David touched him. They exchanged something that was an intimate gift giving time. 

I sometimes ponder on Genesis 3 after Adam and Eve sin. This says that God to, um, models, what it was necessary to restore them from sin and sacrifices an animal and, and takes the skins and prepares clothes. This must have taken some time. They were watching him. You don't just kill an animal and, and in an instant have clothes. And this process would've been intimate and compelling it, and I would've fashioned it just the right size for him and for her. And, and then it says this amazing thing. And he clothed them before they left the garden. God was like at the Butler, helping them get dressed, um, before they left the garden. Can you imagine the way he touched them? The way he would've done this with tenderness and love and kindness? I imagine there were lots of tears shared, shed that day, as they realized what they'd given through their rebellious sin.

Touch is important. We can touch in right ways and we can touch in wrong ways. Our different cultures have different ideas about touch and what's appropriate. And what's inappropriate. As I've traveled into over 200 nations of the earth, I've learned a lot of things of what to do and what not to do. Where I grew up in south America, we are very affectionate people among, Latin Americans. And depending on the country you're in, when you'll get introduced to someone new, you will extend your hand and, and probably, uh, touch your cheek with their cheek and kind of blow a kiss into the air, both on the right side and then on the left side. And sometimes you do on two sides and other countries you just do once. And in some countries, you do it with both men and women together, or sometimes you do it just with the genders are opposite. It varies from place to place. And if you know the right way to touch then people know, oh, he knows my culture 

And in North America, you tend to shake hands and very close; in Europe, you shake hands a little further away. And in Asia touches too, too intimate. If you just meet someone, so you don't touch it just bow. Which is the right way? That's not the correct quite they're all right within their culture. They're all exhibiting different forms of values of one of honor and respect or one of intimacy and caring and touch, the way you touch, tells the other what part of the world you're from. See again, the way you touch, what is considered appropriate \- tells you something about the community you're from that establishes your identity, your cultural values. We need to touch in ways that are appropriate and avoid inappropriate touch. 

**Celebration Sphere 25: (Touch displays True Love)**   
Our second passage on touch. And this is how touch displays true love Luke 7:36-47. And we are just gonna look at some selections. One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him. When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell at his feet and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them. Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon, look at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home, you didn’t… But she has … and then again, you didn't, but she has. And then again, you neglected…but she has… you can fill in the details by reading the whole scripture. I tell you her sins though they are many have been forgiven. So she has so me much love, But a person who is forgiven little Shows, only little love, 

Touch, genuine touch, Appropriate touch, compelling touch is a sign of true love. She has. He didn’t. Simon didn't wash his feet, didn't anoint his head, didn't care for him, but she had. True touch is something to be highly valued and celebrated. 

**Celebration Sphere 26: Smell: (Identity and Connections)**  
This is the first of two passages on the, the sense of smell. And this one is about Identity and Connections. Genesis 27:26-27. Then Isaac said to Jacob, please come a little closer and kiss me my son. So Jacob went over and kissed him. And when Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he was finally convinced and he blessed his son. He said, ah, the smell of, my son is like the smell of the outdoors, which the Lord has blessed. 

You see Isaac was old. He was almost blind. And he couldn't tell his one son from the other son. He couldn't tell Esau from Jacob. And Jacob was tricking his father with his mother's home into getting a blessing that Esau should have had. And so mom knew that dad wouldn’t see very well that sense of the five senses wasn't functioning. So she made sure that that Jacob was clothed with Esau's clothing because he smelled different. And so Isaac thought that when he smelled Esau's clothing on Jacob, that he was blessing Esau. Aromas are powerful. 

We often say that when we tell the stories of romance that it was love at first sight. Actually science tells us that it was probably love at first smell. But that doesn't sound nearly as romantic. But the aromas often that are very subtle that we pick up- even we can't even, and our brain doesn't even register that we're making a judgment or a decision, but they tell us, I like this person. I don't like this person- right from the very beginning. And think about it. Maybe you had a really wonderful grandma. Now not everyone does, but more often than not, Grandma's house is a place of comfort and delight. You get a lot more candies at grandma's house right now than you did for mom and dad. You got a little more spoiled and a little more pampered at grandma house. And there's a place of acceptance. You are always, always welcome at grandma's house. At least that's the hope for desire 

And grandma's house probably has some aromas associated with it. I remember my grandma's house, she always had African violets and she canned fruit and she, there were aromas about that house that I later in life when I smelled something like that, for some reason, I thought “I like this place” and I wouldn't think why do I like this place? And I pause and consider it her life. Ah, that was like, grandma's home cooking was like the smell in grandma's living room. That was like the perfume that grandma used and that, that delightful association between the aroma and a place of beauty and security of relational comfort made me open in that new context. So we need to understand the, the power of this idea. 

We had some friends from Argentina who went to an arts festival in Scotland and they performed a theatrical piece and they got rave reviews. And one of the things that helped this, enabled this, to happen is because they understood the power of the five senses. Instead of just appearing on stage. At the beginning of the drama, the actors all in attire would be, would do the job of being ushers. And as they welcome people in, they would give a rose to the women and they would give a piece, some food that was typical of Argentina to everyone. And so they would smell the flower and they would enjoy the aromas of the Argentine culinary arts. And even before the play started, this doesn't usually happen in the theater. There was a winsomness, an attraction. Ah, that was great. They knew how to use all of the senses in their artistry. 

So when they used all these five senses, they won awards. They won accolades because they wisely used all the gifts that God has given us to build relationship, to bring beauty, to bring delight into our lives. 

**Celebration Sphere 27: (Smell: Triggers Opposing Reactions)**   
This is the second passage on Smell that we want to look at. And we recognize that almost sometimes Trigger Opposing Reactions, 2 Corinthians 2:14-16 Now God use us Paul writes to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere. Like a sweet perfume. Our lives are Christ like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved than by those who are perishing to those who are perishing we are a dreadful smell of death and doom, but to those who are being saved, we are a life giving perfume. 

The same aroma can produce different reactions in different people. Flowers for example. A rose is known for as beautiful aroma, and it is\! Unless you have hay fever or some kind of allergy. And then that aroma, instead of being a pleasure is painful. We need to understand that using of these gifts are shaped by how the recipients receive them. And so we need to tailor all of our celebration, all of our use of, of the different senses in a way that advances the purposes of God.

**Celebration Sphere 28: (Sound: Carries Cultural Stories)**   
The first passage on sound. Sound: Carries Cultural Stories. Judges 5:11 says this, Listen to the village musicians gathered at the watering holes. They recount the righteous victories of the Lord and the victories of his villagers in Israel, then the people of the Lord marched down to the city gates. 

Wow, what a great passage. Sound, What we hear, impacts us. It changes us. It creates memories that are so important. Now, I, I love music of every kind of classical music, cultural music of various forms, all kinds of contemporary music. Perhaps you've heard this to…

At this point, you could probably keep humming that tune. And you may or may not know that that is the beginning of the choral in the final movement of Beethoven's ninth symphony. It's a masterful piece. It's been played thousands of times in hundreds of stages in probably most every country on earth. And it's just absolutely exquisite. I've had the privilege of seeing it live multiple times. I listen to it on my electronic devices, my digital tools and it's, it is absolutely beautiful. And at times I find myself after having just experienced that, I talked with someone who's also done that, and they've not been, they went out of same concert at the same time I was, but the fact that I know Beethoven’s ninth and listened to it live and they, at some point know, Beethoven's ninth and listened it at some other place, at some other time in their life, gives us an immediate opportunity to connect with one another. Music links us together. I don't have to be at the same theater at the same time or the same concert or the same experience, or the fact that, you know this song and great songs live beyond a moment live beyond space and time. They, they expand throughout the world and they are, are connectors for us. 

Another piece of classical music that I really love is Handel's Messiah. I've seen it live in concerts in various countries and multiple continents, and I never get tired of it. It's such a more wonderful thing to experience with others or to talk about with others who experienced it at some other place. When you get to the Hallelujah chorus, it's absolutely wonderful as you hear those first sounds being played \-to rise to your feet and people all over the world have a custom of rising to their feet. It's a point of unity. This was happened because the king who heard it the first time, this was played by Handel in, in England, he rose to his feet. And as a tradition, we all do that. And so the common music and a common action, millions of people have done the exact same thing at the exact same moment of this musical piece, different generations, different cultures in different venues at different times. And it's a unifier. It gives us something common. Celebration. Song. Sound unifies us. 

**Celebration Sphere 29: (Sound: Declares Redemptive Hopes)**  
This is our second passage on Sound and it declares redemptive hopes. Psalm 150:1-6. Praise the Lord, praise God in his sanctuary, praise him in his mighty heaven. Praise him for his mighty works. Praise his unequal greatness, praise him with a blast of the Rams. horn praise him with a lyer and heart. Praise him with a tambourine and dancing, praising with strings and flus, praising with a clash of symbols, praising with loud, clanging symbols, let everything that has breath seem praises to the Lord. Praise the Lord. 

You can see that invitation not only to have the right focus in our worship and our music making in our production of sound, but an invitation for all to be involved. All these different instruments and not just instruments, but voices and dancing. And these expressions are as a place where diversity of skills come together with a unity of purpose to declare the redemptive hopes that we have because our God is so good. And he deserves our praise. 

**Celebration Sphere 30: (Sight: Dramatic Arts In the Scriptures)**  
we introduced the concept of sight, the fifth and final of our five senses. And remember as we began, we talked about taste that happens in us. Touch happens on the edge of us, where my fingers or my hand touches your fingers, your hand or your shoulder or whatever. There's just something that touch. Smell happens close by. You can smell something, a ladies perfume when you're within a few feet of her. But this, this gift of sight lets us look across space and see distant galaxies. 

Each of these senses take us progressively towards more and more of God's world to embrace a greater community of being connected in a larger and larger universe. And so sight is very powerful and we see it is often used in the scriptures with dramatic arts, where, where things are visualized. One example of many is 2 Samuel 14\. And I'm gonna read some selections from verse one to 11\. Joab sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom. Then Joab told her what to say. When the woman from Tekoa approached the king, that's David, she bowed with her face to the ground in deep respect and cried out oh, king help me. What is the trouble? The king asked. Alas I am a widow. She replied, my husband is dead. My two sons had a fight out in the field. And so since no one was there to stop it, one of them was killed. Now the rest of the family want to extinguish the only coal I have left.  Leave it to me, the king told her, go home, not a hair on your son's head will be just to her. 

So she tells the story. It's a fictional narrative to try to show the importance of extending mercy and doing the right thing. 

There's power in drama. There's power in theater, there's power in the visual arts and movie making and films. Hearing a story well told is compelling. Seeing it portrayed on a big screen can be even more captivating. Story is powerful. You know, if you see it, you believe it. And it's compelling and it gives great connectivity. You feel like you were there. When you see something on the news or you experience something of entertainment at a show, you feel like you are part of that story and you, you connect powerfully to it. That's why about some 80% of scriptures are story, they are dialogue, they’re narrative, that help in a picture to help you see what God has done and who he is like. 

**Celebration Sphere 31: (Sight: Visual Arts and the Scriptures)**  
**…**is our second passage on Sight. The final of the five senses. We want to talk about the Visual arts and the scriptures. And we're gonna talk about this from Ezekiel 37:1-10. Here are some selections. The Lord took hold of me. Ezekiel said, and I was carried away by the spirit of the Lord to a valley, filled with bones. They were scattered everywhere across the ground and were completely dried out. Then he asked me, son, man, can these bones become living people again? Oh, so the Lord, I replied. You alone know the answer to that. Then he said to me, speak a prophetic message to these bones of say my bones, listen to the word of Lord. So I spoke the message as He commanded me and breath, came into their bodies. They all came to life and stood up on their feet. A great army. 

Wow. You need to read the whole passage. This is such a visually engaging story. Bones, dry, lifeless coming together are forming into reasonably shaped skeletons, then rising to their feet and having flesh attached to them. And then finally, breath of life. Wow. God is the God can do absolutely the most impossible things, not just resurrecting a body that is dead a few hours or a few days, but taking dried out, sun washed bones and making people alive again. 

Incredible. Visual arts are powerful. They inspire us. They give us direction. And you know, we experience this in every dimension of our life. When you go to a football stadium or a soccer stadium, and your team is playing an opposing team. And maybe your team wears yellow jerseys and your, the other team wears red jerseys. You’re wearing, of course the jersey of your team. You go into the stadium and you look around and you see are the yellow jerseys and where are the red jerseys? And you sit accordingly. And you sit with a bunch of people that you didn't know before, but when your team scores a goal and the people wearing the same color of jerseys that you have on all jump up and rejoice \- you're, high-fiving everyone. They become your lifelong friends. You treat them like you've always known them. Why? You, you belong to them. They're your community because they're wearing the same color of shirt, the same color of jersey as you are. Visual signage speaks to us. 

Friends when we see things as we ought to see, we envision what God purposes for us. And so we need to learn how to use the visual arts to advance the kingdom of God. And so grateful for all those people of faith who are using their awareness of taste and touch and smell, and sound and sight to advance the kingdom of God. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION**  
This next section is about the prophet artist and will contain nine different passages. Interestingly the Bible, although it has several lists of gifts, it never any one of them has the gift of the artist. However, if you look at the scriptures a little more carefully, the prophets and their ministries often associated with the artistic gift. And I think it's in part because the prophet is like a social commentator. He points out what is amiss in society and calls for change. Very often the artist has a similar passion, using their art to address the ills of their society, whether it's sculpture or painting or literature or theater or, photography or film, it's movies. They’re communicating points of passion, highlighting areas of injustice and calling people back to what they deemed is correct. Of course, in the scriptures, these prophets/artists are hearing from God and speaking the word of God, to the people of Israel and to the surrounding nations. 

**Celebration Sphere 32: The Inner Life of the Prophet Artist.**   
We read from Habakkuk 1:1. This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in the vision. 

Now we can read in 1 Samuel 9:9, this interesting commentary. The author, who's obviously compiling this book generations after the original events says in those days, if people wanted a message from God, they would say, let's go and ask the Seer for the prophets used to be called Seers. Now the Seer, the Hebrew word is raha? Is different from the prophet, which is n---, uh, and it literally means one who sees one who envisions. 

And what we have at the outset of the book of Habakkuk is that he has a vision. He has a visual reception. He sees something in his spirit and his mind's eyes in some way. It is not an abstract conceptual idea, but he has a vision. And that is what informs the prophetic message. And that vision is very artistic. 

**Celebration Sphere 33: Use of the Dramatic Arts.**   
I'm gonna read some selections from 1 Kings 11:29-39. One day as Jereboam was leaving Jerusalem. The prophet, A--- from Shiloh met him along the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone in the field and A--- took hold of cloak he was wearing and tore into 12 pieces. That he said to Gerald, take 10 of these pieces for, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says. I'm about to tear the kingdom from the head of Solomon. And I'll give you 10 tribes to you, and I'll place you on the throne of Israel. And you'll rule over all that your heart desires because of Solomon's sin, I will punish the descendants of David though, not forever. 

This prophet got the attention of the soon to be king of Israel, through the use of drama, through the theatrical representation of the message that God had given him. As we look through the scriptures, this is the first of many times, at least 30 instances in which the prophets used theater to convey the idea. They, it’s throughout Kings and Chronicles and Isaiah, Jeremiah, major prophets, again and again. Jeremiah is a fan of doing this. And chapter 13, he buries a linen cloth by a river bank and later digs it up. And that, that action, that dramatized action becomes the foundation for a prophetic word. 

In Jeremiah 16 in his personal life became a theater. He didn't get married. He didn't have children that becomes a theme for prophetic message. In Jeremiah 18 he goes to a Potter's house. So he looks at how pots are made, and that becomes a theme for a message. In Jeremiah 19, he buys a clay jar and he breaks this clay jar shatters it into a thousand pieces with great drama, with great flare. And that becomes the foundation for another message. And on and on and on, if you keep going with Jeremiah and others, but you get the idea. These guys, not only had a word, but they thought, how do I present it? And they chose visual artistic, dramatic theatrical means to communicate the word of God and then build a conceptual understanding around that.

**Celebration Sphere 34: Use of the Literary Arts.**   
We're gonna read Lamentations 1:1. Jerusalem, once so full of people is now deserted. She was what's great among the nations. Now sit alone like a widow. Once the queen of all the earth, she's now a slave. 

Now prophetic literature as a whole is always more elaborate, takes a little more artistry, a little more skill than normal prose. That's true in most languages, certainly true in Hebrew. Now Hebrew poetry is not like English. It's not about rhythm and rhyme. Poetry is about parallelism. Having two ideas match each other, using different words, synonymous phrases to add enriched meanings. This is so wise of God to choose a people who spoke Hebrew and their literary form of poetry, because it's very easily to translate without losing the sense of the poetry. You can't do that from English into other languages, but it does work from Hebrew. So this poetry requires a literary excellence. You don't just, it's not just a flow of consciousness. You think, and then you say, how can I make that better? How can I enrich that? And another statement and how you build on that. And it's a conceptual artistry that is exquisite. And most of our Bibles in English, we are able to see that because the way that text is laid out is different. Instead of being in paragraphs they’re in, in stanzas. And this helps us see there's something special. This literature is more, refined, more artistic. 

So Jeremiah, like the other prophets was not only a great artist and used poetry in his proclamations, but we also know that he was according to the 2 Chronicles 35:25, the author of Lamentations. And he did something more than just do poetry. Lamentations is a quadruple acrostic. What does that mean? And acrostic is a poetry where every line begins with a different letter of the alphabet. In Hebrew there are 22 letters. And so chapter one, chapter two and chapter four each have 22 verses, each verse begins like their equivalent of the ABCDs alphabet GI do the Hebrew 22 letters. And so it makes it really easy for people to memorize, and remember, because each point begins with a different letter. Chapter three has 66 verses because there are three A's, three B's, three C's, three D's all the way down. Now that takes a lot of creativity and thoughtfulness to write something like that in the best of circumstances. 

But when he wrote Lamentations, it was the worst of circumstances. It was time of great national tragedy, the most horrific destruction; the weeping and the sorrow the depth of the emotion was so intense. And yet he was able to maintain the discipline of an artist and channel the extreme emotions that he had, the unimaginable pain into this extraordinary literary discipline and keep it ordered by these letters. You can see the self control of the Spirit of God in the midst of the human anguish. What an amazing artistry, what great skill. This is only achieve through years and years of honing this ability. 

**Celebration Sphere 35: (Use of the Musical Arts)**  
 …the prophet artist Use the Musical Arts. And 2 Kings 3:15. we read, Elisha speaking. …Now bring me someone who can play the harp. And while the harp was being played, the power of the Lord came upon Elisha. 

Wow. We think of the times when David played the harp before Saul, it by ministry to him. And music released or created a platform for the prophetic gift, for one to step out of their current situations and it will reflect on the character nature of the ways of God. 

I remember a time at our conference in Sweden that we had present some renowned classical musicians. They performed in many orchestras around the world and one of them in particular, it was a quartet, was an oboist, probably one of the top five oboist in the world. And they played incredible music. And a couple times, they, they jammed. Not a jazz session, this was a classical music jamming and it was extraordinary. This oboist would walk through the crowd and play his oboe over people. And they would be healed. The Spirit of God would evidence, words of prophecy would come. And what was true back in     Elisha's day is still true today. The artist prophets using the music and the Word of Lord, go hand in hand, if we'll hone those skills in a way that pleases God. 

**Celebration Sphere 36: The Whole Church as Artists.**   
Ephesians 3:10 says God's purpose in all of this, in this proclamation of the gospel. And the extension of the kingdom of God was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety, to all the unseen rulers and authority in the heavenly places. 

As the people of God we’re called to display his wisdom, to visually portray, to put on a show, to demonstrate in a tangible concrete way. The amplified Bible says so now through the church, the multifaceted wisdom of God in all of its countless aspects might now be made, known, revealing the mystery to the angelic rulers and authorities in heavenly places. 

We have the incredible as the body of, to display God's wisdom. How amazing that he saved us. And this is a message that needs to be understood by all on earth and all in heavenly places. Let's be be a, let's be a theatric presentation of God's good purposes.

NOTE: There is not a video for:  “The next two passages are about how you finance the prophet artists. This is really important.”

**Celebration Sphere 37: (Individual Financing of the Arts)**  
Passage 37 is the Individual Financing of the Arts. 2 Kings 4:8-11. One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there and she urged him to come to her home for meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to eat. 

She said to her husband, “I'm sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God. Let's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by. 

One day, Elisha returned to Shunem. 

And there was this prophet's chamber that had been built. And throughout history, the private benefactors have been needed to support the prophet artists. They are the ones who, who champion and undergird, and facilitate the work of the ministry of these remarkable people. 

**Celebration Sphere 38: (Corporate Financing of the Arts)**   
We continue with the theme of financing the prophet artists, this time, the Corporate Financing of the Arts.  1 Chronicles 25:1-8. David and the army commanders then appointed men from the family of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun to proclaim God's messages to the accompaniment of lyres, harps and cymbals… All these men were under the direction of their fathers as they made music at the house of the Lord. Their responsibilities, including the playing of cymbals, harps, and lyres at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman reported directly to the king. They and their families were all trained in making music before the Lord. And each of them \- 288 in all — was an accomplished musician. The musicians who were appointed to their term of service by means of sacred lots, without regard to whether they were young or old teacher or student. 

Wow, there were 288 musicians on the payroll of the government, called to make music and worship God. Public support is often needed to support the prophet artists. And this is a remarkable example of that in the scriptures. 

**Celebration Sphere 39: Repetitive Events Platforming the Arts.**   
This is from Nahum 1:15, Celebrate your festivals O people of Judah, and fulfill all your vows for your wicked enemies who will never invade your land again. They will be completely destroyed. 

Regular seasonal annual festivities need to be a part of the role of the contribution of the prophet artist. We need them helping us do the things that God's called us to do in a regular ongoing basis. 

**Celebration Sphere 40: (Unique Events Platforming the Arts)**   
There are also Unique Events Platforming the Arts.  Revelation 7:9-12. After this, I saw a vast crowd, too great to count from every nation and tribe and people and language standing in front into the throne before the lamb, they were clothed in white robes and held Palm branches in their hands, and they were shouting with a great war. Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne in front, the lamb, and all the angels were standing around the throne around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their face, the brown and worship God. They say amen, blessing and glory, wisdom, and Thanksgiving, and honor our power and strength along to our God forever ever. Amen. 

That's gonna be a really unique festival. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you are too. And when we come together at unique moments, and this is gonna be a historic moment, it's gonna be one of those unique moments that goes on for a very, very long time. that, um, The arts come forth. You sing, you shout. There's coordinated language. And we, we worship. This is one of the most beautiful expressions of art. We need the gift of the prophet artist in those settings as well. 

**SECTION INTRODUCTION: JESUS AND THE ARTS**  
In this section, we're looking at Jesus and the Arts. We'll consider four passages and there could be many more how Jesus employed the arts in order to get his message across in ways that impacted and transformed lives. 

**Celebration Sphere 41: Jesus Employed Humor.**   
Luke 14:18-21. Now, before I read this passage, I want to say that if you give the punchline away before the end of the joke, it ruins the joke. And sometimes we've read these passages so many times we know the final line and we don't get the punchline feel. So I'm gonna read this, this part of the scriptures, and I'm gonna try to help you recreate how the original audience would've heard the punchline and certainly they would've laughed. 

But they all began making excuses \[Jesus said in this parable about the wedding Feast\]. One said, I have just bought a field and I must inspect it. Please. Excuse me. Another said, I've just bought five pairs of oxen and I want to try them out, please. Excuse me. Another said, I just got married. So I can't come. The servant returned and told his master of what they had said. His master was furious and said go quickly into the streets and allies of the town and bite the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame. 

Did you laugh? Did you get the punchlines? There are three of them. Who buys a field without first checking it out, without first inspecting it? That's silly.  I just bought a field. I'm gonna go and take a look and see what I bought. No one does that. Like people like that's a stupid excuse. That's a lame excuse. That's so silly that ridiculous. The next one was like, I just bought five pairs of oxen, ten oxen. And I'm going to go and see if they're any good. No one does that\! This is such a lame excuse. So I bought, I bought the field. I gotta check it out. I've bought these oxen. I gotta check it out. Then I just got married and you can kind thinking, I gotta check her out. You know, he doesn't say that, but it just, just the pause that the guy go, oh yeah, we get, we, we know what, what needs happened. So I can't come. And that, that was, and chuckles would've been all around it. Would've elicited laughter from the crowd, because these were ridiculous excuses. 

But Jesus used humor many times. In Matthew seven and Luke six we have him telling the story of the man who has a sees a friend with a speck in his eye and wants to take the speck out of his eye. But he's got a trunk in his eye. You can see that when Jesus said, I'm sure he didn't just say it. And, And there was a man who had a speck in his eye and another man with a trunk in his eye. He probably had inflection in voice. Maybe he would dramatized it, try look at the speck doing maybe, maybe he had picked up along and stuck it in his eye. And people would've laughed at what a ridiculous proposition this was. This incredible, delightful exaggeration must have been an hilarious crowd pleaser. And it stuck. When we laugh, things stay with us. It impacts our memories and our emotions are engaged. And then the truth lands a little more deeply. Jesus was a great teacher. So he employed humor wisely. 

**Celebration Sphere 42: Jesus Sang and Quoted Songs.**   
Mark 15:34 These are words that Jesus speaks of the cross. And let me back up before I read these words. When he finished the last supper and left with his disciples to the garden of Gethsemane and began the process those last final hours of being arrested and this mock trial, and then taken to Golgotha to be crucified. He left that last supper singing songs. Probably from the book of Psalms. And so we know he sang with his disciples. He's at the Cross. It’s three o'clock in the afternoon. And he says at 3:00 Jesus called out with a loud voice El Elani, which means my God and my God, why have you abandoned me? 

And we can often misunderstand what's going on. Like, was God really mean to you, Jesus, at that moment, did he turn his back on him and walk away? No, no. What is Jesus doing? He's giving the first line of a psalm, just like when we are in a worship service. And we sing, let's sing Amazing Grace. Those are the first words of a song. That's how often the, the titles of songs are. And when you hear Amazing Grace, we know how to, what to start singing. So when he said, my God, my God, why you abandoned me? Why have you forsaken me, this is the opening line of Psalm 22, which is a Messianic song. And what he's saying to all those present, if you want to know what what's going on here, think about this song, go back and check out this song. And he's calling, he's like a worship leader saying this will give meaning to what is going on. 

It begins with my God, my God. Why have you forsaken me? But then go on. Let's just read some portion of that Psalm and see how pertinent it is. In verse seven it says everyone who sees me, mocks me. They sneer and shake their heads saying, is this the one who relies on the Lord? Then let the Lord say to him. If the Lord loves him so much, let the Lord rescue him. You know, in Matthew 27:43, it says the, the crowd, he trusted God, now Let God rescue him now if he wants him. He said, I am the son. God, The crowd is saying exactly what the psalmist said would happen. 

And verse nine says you brought me safely from my mother's womb and led me to trust you at my mother's breast. This is a declaration of his confidence in God, not a sense of abandonment. I was thrust into your arms at my birth. You have been my God from the moment I was born. There's intimacy of relationship. Verse 12 \[and 14\]. But my enemy enemies surround me like a herd of bulls; fierce bulls of Bashan have hemmed me in\! … My life is poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. 

You know, this is a description of, of crucifixion. When you're hanging on the cross, the, the weight of your body as is such that eventually your, your joints start popping- your elbows and your knees and your hips and your shoulders. They can't sustain the weight of the body for days on end, which is the normal time of crucifixion. My heart is like wax melting within me. We know that later on when they Jesus, the, and they pierced his sides, both, um, blood and water came out. When you do an autopsy, there's usually, the body is filled, the cavities either with blood or with water, but you don't have both of them occur except in only one occasion \- when there's a massive cardiac arrest, the heart literally explodes. And it just, it disintegrates. This is what he's talking about. 

My strength has dried up like sun-baked clay. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You have laid you \- Remember Jesus said, I'm thirsty? You laid me in the dust and left me for dead. My enemies surround me like a pack of dogs; an evil gang closes in on me. They have pierced my hands and feet. How accurate of a crucifixion. 

Verse 18 of Psalm 22 says, “they divide my garments among themselves and throw dice for my clothing, which is exactly what was happening. And then verse 19 says you are my strength Lord, come quickly to my aid\! …Snatch me from the lion’s jaws and from the horns of these wild oxen. I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters. I will praise to you among the assembled people. Verse 23, praise the Lord. All you who fear him, honor him all you descendants of Jacob, show him, reverence all your descendants of Israel for he has not ignored or belittled the suffering of the needy. He has not turned his back on them, but he has listened to their cries for help. God had not abandoned him. He doesn't abandon anyone. He's not a God who turns his back on people in needy. Okay? 

The whole earth verse 27 will acknowledge the Lord and return to him. All the families of the nations will bow down before him. For all power belongs to the Lord. He rules all the nations… Future generations will hear about the wonders of the Lord. His righteous acts will be told to those not yet born. They will hear about everything has done. That's how this song that begins with my God, my God, how are you forsaking me this incredible declaration of God's victory and the confidence that the good news of his victory will go through all the earth for all the generations to come. This is a song of triumph and Jesus, who is aware of the power of the arts quotes this song and expects you to look at him on the cross and read through and sing along with him and make sense of what is going on. Because the Psalmist, the artist, the prophet has described exactly what God was doing through our wonderful savior Jesus at that moment in history. 

**Celebration Sphere 43: Jesus Attended Celebratory Events.**   
Perhaps the most famous is found in John 2:1-11. The next day, there was a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration. The wine supply ran out during the festivities… So Jesus' mother told the servants, do whatever he tells you… Jesus told the servants, fill the jars with water. Now, dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies. So the servants followed his instructions. When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, …he said, you have kept it best until now\! This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory and his disciples believed in him. 

Jesus was not only present at the celebration, He helped. He contributed to this celebration, made sure it would be a success. It would've been shameful for the family that was hosting the event if they had run out of the requisite beverages at the, at the festivities. And so when there was a beverage crisis, he pulled out all the stops to pull off the event. And he, they did it successfully. He participated in the artistry in the celebration of that event. And we should too. Jesus loved the stuff of life. He loved the joys and the celebrations and invites us to enter into his joy, because he is absolutely extraordinary. I think that the thing that was key about what made his artistry so excellent is that he involves people, others to do work with him. And the key was though he had this magnificent plan of furthering the celebration. They needed to simply follow his instructions. That's what we're called to do as prophet artists. 

**Celebration Sphere 44: Jesus Created Celebratory Events.**   
1 Corinthians 11:23-26. I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broken in pieces and said, this is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, He took the cup of wine after supper, saying, this cup is a new covenant between God and his people \- an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it. For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again. 

Jesus not only attended celebratory events, he created one. He hosted one and he set it up as a paradigm, an example, something to be repeated and millions and millions of millions of Christians over scores of generations in every part of the earth have participated in this celebration. Remembering his remarkable new covenant. It's a, he created a repeatable memory and it involves all of our five senses that we've talked about. It was very tactile, the very relational and absolutely redemptive.

SECTION

In this next section, we only have two passages. It's about biblical principles for sports. Now the Bible doesn't have stories of many of the sports that are popular amongst us today. It doesn't speak about soccer or football or rugby or cricket or hockey or basketball or the Olympics. But it does talk about sports that were known in those days and often uses inspiring examples about how we should live our life. 

**Celebration Sphere 45: Target Practice.**   
I'm gonna read selections from 1 Samuel 20:18-42. In this passage we’re gonna be looking at a story in which Jonathan and David are having a conversation. Jonathan is the son of the king, the heir apparent and his friend, David is the one who would actually be the king. And so Jonathan's father is angry at David and wanting to kill him. That's the context of this story. 

So then Jonathan said to David, tomorrow, we celebrate the New Moon festival. You'll be missed when your place at the table is empty. The day after tomorrow wait there by the stone pile, I will come out and shoot three arrows to the side of the stone pile. As though I was shooting at a target, then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back. If you hear me, tell him, then you will know. So David hid himself in the field. The next morning as agreed Jonathan went out as the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows. So the boy ran and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. He of course suspected nothing only Jonathan and David understood the signal. As soon as the boy was gone, they embraced each other and said goodbye. Then David left and Jonathan returned to the town. 

They were able to pull off this subterfuge, have the little boy there. And the code was, if I shoot there, I say, arrows are beyond you, it means dad's mad and he is going to kill you, get out of town as fast as you can. And the little boy didn't suspect anything at all. And, um, probably an armor bearer in training. So the extraordinary thing about this passage is that it wasn't extraordinary. The young lad caught the arrows, brought him back and left without any suspicion because target practice is something Jonathan regularly did. That's what sports is. It's about regular disciplines of athletic feats that are done over and over and over again. It was an ordinary activity in Jonathan's life in David's life. And therefore nothing unusual in the eyes of the young man. Sport training should be an expected part of life. It is talked about it in that way in the Bible. 

**Celebration Sphere 46: Disciplined Training.**   
We read from 1 Corinthians 9:24-27. Don't you realize that in a race, everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize. So run to win. All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for the eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I'm not just shadow boxing. I discipline my body like an athlete training and to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others, I might myself be disqualified. 

Sporting Motifs inspire motivation. Dedication. Discipline. Hard work. Day in, day out. It's like such a perfect example for discipleship. If we want to be a follower of Jesus, we must have the commitment to be trained in righteousness the same way an athlete is trained in his sport. 

**CROSSOVER PASSAGES**  
Our final section, as in all of the spheres are the crossover passages between celebration and each of the other spheres. So we'll look at these six passages now. 

**Celebration Sphere 47: Celebration and Family.**   
We read Genesis 21:8. When Isaac grew up and was about to be weaned, Abraham prepared a huge feast to celebrate the occasion. 

Family celebrations are important. Take time to celebrate important milestones, birthdays, anniversaries. (husbands, that’s really important). In our family, we practice what we call Fiesta math. It's based on Psalm 90:12, he says, Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. So I count every day and we not only celebrate birthdays like one year, two years, three years, but 500 days, a thousand days, 1,500 days. And so you average three parties in a two year period. More Fiesta without any additional aging. That's really a good way to increase celebration in your life. And it's important to apply Psalm 90\. The idea is to make every day count, don't waste any single day in foolishness or things that draw you away from the things of God. Numbers our days that we might apply our heart to wisdom. Let's celebrate family to life together. 

**Celebration Sphere 48: Celebration and Economics.**   
Proverbs 17:22, a cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person strength. The sphere of economics along with the spheres of family, religion and government are all concerned about healthcare. If an individual is ill or dies, everyone suffers. So all are preoccupied with the health of each and every individual. But here the sphere of celebration is a key contributor as well because a cheerful heart does good like a medicine. And a regular dose of celebration is good for one's health. So go to your a doctor and have him write out a prescription: Celebrate more. 

**Celebration Sphere 49: Celebration and Government.**   
We're reading from 1 Kings 1 selections from verses 32 to 40\. Then king David ordered call Zadok the priest, Nathan, the prophet and B\_\_\_\_\_ When they came into the King's presence, the king said to them take Solomon. And my officials down to the Gahon spring Solomon is to ride on my own mule, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. So Zakok the priest, took the Flask of olive oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon with the oil. Then they sounded the Rams horn and all the people shouted long, lived king Solomon and all the people followed Solomon into Jerusalem, playing flutes and shouting for joy. The celebration was so joyous and noisy that the earth shook with the sound. 

While that's a powerful celebration when it provokes an earthquake. Coronations or perhaps better today, inaugurations and other national holidays that commemorate important historical milestones, independence days, battles of various points in the nation's history are so important. These are ways in which governments join with the people in the acts of celebration. 

**Celebration Sphere 50: Celebration and Religion.**   
We're gonna read selections from Acts 16:25- 34 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the other prisoners were listening. Suddenly there was a massive earthquake… The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open. He ran to the dungeon …and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he, he brought them out. Sirs\! What must I do to be saved? They replied believe in the Lord, Jesus, and you'll be saved Along with everyone in your household. Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized. He brought them into his house and set a meal before them and he and his entire household rejoiced because they've all believed in God. 

Celebratory worship triggered an earthquake, which led to the redemptive purposes of God, responding from heaven, Touching that jail and touching the household of the jailer. It ended up with universal rejoicing as people experience redemption of God and they celebrated around a meal, enjoying the culinary arts and the goodness of God who had intervened so miraculously in that night. 

**Celebration Sphere 51: Celebration and Education**  
This is taken from Deuteronomy 31:19-22. God instructs Moses saying, so write down the words of this song and teach it to the people of Israel, help them learn it. So it may serve as a witness for me against them for, I will bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors a land flowing with milk and honey. There they shall become prosperous, eat all the food they want and become fat, but they will begin to worship other gods. They will despise me and break my covenant. And when great disasters come down on them, this song will stand as evidence against them for it will never be forgotten by their descendants. I know the intentions of these people, even now, before they have entered the land I swore to give them. So that very day Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it to the Israelites. 

Moses was commanded by God to teach the song that he had composed to the next generation and the next generation and the next generation so that people would always remember the acts of God. Music, literature, the arts live on. And if they're infused with the truth of the story of God, it's redemptive message will carry on for generations to come. 

**Celebration Sphere 52: Celebration and Media/Communication.**   
Matthew 13:34, Jesus always used stories in illustrations like these when he spoke to the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to them without using such parables. 

Jesus was a master storyteller. He communicated with great artistry. He was so skillful. The vividness of his examples enabled his spirit to envision the kingdom of God in a very practical and applicable way. This is masterful art. This is great communication. This is Jesus' model for us.
